  <e>[div class="huge"]Dasannaka Jātaka (No.401)[/div][p]Once the Bodhisatta was born as Senaka, a brahmin, counsellor to King Maddava of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"]Benares[/a].  Maddava, seeing that his chaplain's son was yearning for his chief queen, gave her to him for a week.  But at the end of the week the queen ran away with the youth and the king became ill with longing for her.  Senaka thereupon arranged for a festival, in the course of which the king was shown a man swallowing a sword.  The king then asked his counsellors, Ayura, Pukkusa and Senaka, if anything could be harder to do than that.  They, in turn, replied that to promise a gift, to make it, and having made it, not to regret it, these acts were, in increasing degrees, far harder than swallowing a sword made in Dasanna.  The king, grasping the purport of their answers, regained his self-composure.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to a monk who was tempted by his former wife.[/p][p]The king was identified with the monk, Ayura with Moggallāna, and Pukkusa with Sāriputta (J.iii.336-41).[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Dvedhāvitakka Sutta[/div][p]Preached at Jetavana.  The Buddha tells the monks how, before the Enlightenment, he divided his thoughts into two groups - the first being of pleasures of sense, of harm and of hurt, and the other thoughts of renunciation.  He then proceeds to explain how this ultimately led to Enlightenment.  M.i.114ff.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Devanagara[/div][p]Also called Devapura.  A town at the southern point of Ceylon, the modern Dondra.  An old vihāra, repaired by Vijayabāhu I., existed there (Cv.lx.59).  Devanagara is mentioned in the campaigns of Parakkamabāhu I.  as a scene of conflict (Cv.lxxv.47).  There was a temple at Devanagara built (by Dappulasena acc.  to the Sinhalese poem Pārākumbā-Sirita) in honour of the god Uppalavanna.  Here Vīrabāhu celebrated a sacrifice after his victory over the Jāvakas (Cv.lxxxiii.49).  Parakkamabāhu II.  found the shrine in great decay and rebuilt it with great splendour, and inaugurated a festival which is celebrated every year, even up to the present day, in the month of Āsālha (Cv.lxxxv.85).  Parakkamabāhu IV.  built a long-shaped temple of two storeys for the recumbent image of the Buddha, which is found in the vihāra (Cv.xc.94).[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Danta[/div][p]A householder of Nāgakāragāma.  He gave alms for many years to Maliyamahādeva Thera and the monks of Piyangudīpa.  Once, on his way to Suvannabhūmi, he was shipwrecked, but was rescued by Sīhabāhu Thera and brought to Piyangudīpa.  There he saw Sakka and was provided with a ship full of valuables.  The king having heard of him gave him Dantagāma.  Ras.ii.191f.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Dhammagutta Thera[/div][hr][p]1. Dhammagutta Thera.-An arahant.  He lived in the Kalyānika-vihāra and was known as the "earth-shaker" (pathavicālaka).  He was among those who received a share of the meal given by Dutthagāmani when the latter fled from Cūlanganiyapitthi.  He shared his portion with five hundred others (Mhv.xxxii.50; xxiv.24ff).  According to the Jātaka Commentary (J.iv.490), he was among those who joined in the assemblies (samāgama) known as Kuddalasamāgama, Mūgapakkhasamāgama, Ayogharasamāgama and Hatthipalasamāgama.  The Mahāvamsa Tikā (p.606) mentions him as being one of those who accepted the meal of pork given by Sāliya and his wife, when they were blacksmiths, in their birth immediately preceding the last.[/p][p][/p][p]2. Dhammagutta.  A brother of Vedisadevī.  He was one of the nobles who escorted the Bodhi-tree.  He was made Moriyasetthi and given the Moriyajanapada by Devinampiyatissa.  Mbv.166.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Dhammaruci[/div][hr][p]1. Dhammaruci.-One of the heterodox sects of Ceylon which branched off from the Theravāda (Mhv.v.13).  [/p][p][/p][p]According to the Nikāya Sangraha (p.11) this secession took place four hundred and fifty-four years after the death of the Buddha, and in the fifteenth year of the reign of Vattagāmani Abhaya.  The Nikāya Sangraha gives an account of the origin of this sect.  A monk called Mahā-Tissa, incumbent of Abhayagiri, was convicted of living in domestic intercourse and expelled by the Mahāvihāra fraternity.  He thereupon left with his followers and lived apart at Abhayagiri.  They were strengthened by the arrival of some monks from Pallarārāma in South India, descendants of the Vajjiputtakas.  Their teacher was Dhammaruci, and when they joined the Abhayagiri monks, Mahā-Tissa himself took the name of Dhammaruci and his followers became known as Dhammarucikas.  [/p][p][/p][p]The Mahāvamsa Tīkā (p.176) says that Dhammarucika was the name given to the monks of Abhayagiri when they seceded from the Mahāvihāra, and gives elsewhere (p.676f) the points on which they differed from the Theravādins.  These points concerned minor teachings of the Vinaya.  The Dhammarucikas became active in the time of Meghavannābhaya, and the king, after an enquiry into the matter, sent sixty of them into exile.  They again became powerful in the time of Mahāsena, through the influence of Sanghamitta, and almost succeeded in destroying the Mahāvihāra.  But this disaster was averted by the intervention of the king's friend and counsellor, Meghavannābhaya, and Sanghamitta was killed by one of the queens (Mhv.xxxvii.17ff).[/p][p][/p][p]In spite of Sanghamitta's untimely end, the Dhammarucikas seem to have enjoyed favour in Ceylon during a long period.  Dhātusena gave over to them the Ambatthala-vihāra, which he built on Cetiyapabbata (Cv.xxxviii.75), and Kassapa I, bestowed on them the vihāra he built in the Niyyanti garden, and made all provisions for their comfort (Cv.xxxix.17).  Moggallāna I, gave over to them the Dalha-vihāra (Cv.xxxix.41) and Aggabodhi V.  the Rājinādīpika-vihāra (Cv.xlviii.1).  Sena Ilanga, general of Kassapa IV., built for them the Dhammārāma and the Hadayunha-parivena (Cv.lii.17, 18).[/p][p][/p][p]The Sāgaliyas were an offshoot of the Dhammarucikas.[/p][hr][p]2. Dhammaruci Thera.-An arahant.  In the time of Dipankara Buddha he was a young man named Megha, and on hearing the Buddha's declaration regarding Sumedha, he entered the Order under the latter.  But, owing to wrong association, he left the Order and murdered his mother.  For this he suffered in Avīci and was later born as a fish.  One day he heard some shipwrecked sailors calling on the name of Gotama Buddha for protection, and, remembering Dipankara's prophecy, the fish died.  He was then born in Sāvatthi, and hearing the Buddha preach at Jetavana, he entered the Order and became an arahant.  Ap.ii.429f.[/p][hr][p]3. Dhammaruci.-A Nāga king who gave grass to Atthadassī Buddha for his seat.  BuA.178.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Devatāpañha, Devatāpañha Jātaka[/div][p]Jātaka No.350 is called Devatāpañha Jātaka (J.iii.152), and the Commentary states that the story will be explained in the Ummagga Jātaka.  The Ummagga Jātaka contains a series of questions asked of King Vedeha by the goddess who lived in his parasol, because she wished to restore Mahosadha to the king's favour.  Vedeha inquired of all his wise men, but they could find no answers, and, in the end, he was compelled to send for Mahosadha.  The questions, in the nature of riddles, were put to him and he solved them all.  vi.370f; the riddles with answers are found in pp.376f.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Dhotaka[/div][p]One of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bavari,Bāvarī')"]Bāvarī's[/a] disciples; he was among those who visited the Buddha at Bāvarī's request (SN.  p.194).  The questions he asked of the Buddha on this occasion, and the answers given, are found in the Dhotakamānavapucchā.  SN, p.204f; explained at SNA (ii.592f.) and also Chid.  (19ff.).  He became an arahant.[/p][p][/p][p]In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a brahmin teacher named Chalanga, with a large following, and he built a bridge over the Bhagīrathī for the Buddha and his monks to cross in comfort.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Dāsaka Thera[/div][hr][p]1. Dāsaka Thera.-He was born in Sāvatthi and was appointed by Anāthapindika to look after the vihāra.  There, being impressed by what he saw and heard, he entered the Order.  Some say that he was the son of a slave-woman of Anāthapindika.  The setthi was pleased with him and freed him that he might become a monk.  It is said that in a previous birth he had ordered an arahant to do some work for him, hence his birth as a slave.  From the time he was ordained he became slothful and fond of sleep.  The Buddha admonished him, and, much agitated, he put forth effort and realised arahantship.[/p][p]Ninety-one kappas ago he met the Pacceka Buddha Ajita and gave him some beautiful mangoes to eat.  Later, in the time of Kassapa Buddha, he was a monk (Thag.17; ThagA.i.68ff).[/p][p]Perhaps it is this same Dāsaka who is mentioned in the Samyutta Nikāya (S.iii.127ff; SA.ii.230) as having been sent by the monks of Kosambī to Khemaka, carrying messages to and fro till he had walked up and down over two yojanas.[/p][p][/p][p]2. Dāsaka Thera.-Friend of Sonaka and pupil of Upāli.  He was a learned brahmin of Vesāli, and, meeting Upāli at the Vālikārāma, had a discussion with him, at the end of which he entered the Order for the purpose of studying the Doctrine.  He learnt the whole of the Tipitaka and became an arahant.  Later he ordained Sonaka, son of the caravan-guide, and teacher of Siggava and Candavajji.  After Upāli's death, Dāsaka became chief of the teachers of the Vinaya.  Mhv.v.104ff; Dpv.iv.28ff; v.77ff; Vin.v.2; Sp.i.32, 235; but see Dvy.3ff.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Dīghīti, Dīghati[/div][p]A king of Kosala.  His kingdom was captured by Brahmadatta, king of Kāsi, and he and his wife fled to  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"]Benares[/a], where they lived in disguise in the house of a potter.  His wife bore a son named Dīghāyu (v.l.  Dighāvu).  Before his birth, his mother had a craving to see the army drawn up in battle array, its swords tempered.  Dīghīti appeased her craving with the help of his friend, the chaplain of Brahmadatta.  Dīghāyu was sent away from the city lest harm should befall him, Later, Dīghīti's place of refuge was discovered and he and his wife were being led to the place of execution when Dighāyu, who was on a visit to the city, saw them.  Dīghīti, recognising his son, called to him his dying advice "mā dīgham passa mā rassam " (look not too far nor too near).  Dīghāyu heard and understood; he entered the service of Brahmadatta, first as an elephant-trainer, then as a musician, and finally as his personal servant.  He wished to avenge the death of his parents, but when the occasion arose, he remembered his father's instructions and desisted.  Vin.i.342ff.[/p]</e>

He then proceeded to describe the different kinds of recipients of gifts, the different kinds of givers and the degrees of purity in gifts (M.iii.253ff).[/p][p]The sutta is found word for word in the Sūtrālankāra (Sylvan Levi: JA.1908, xx.99) and is often quoted.

The giver is glad at heart before making the gift, is satisfied while giving, and rejoices after the gift.

The Andhakavenhudāsaputtā tried to take it but in vain, because when the goblin, guarding the city, gave the alarm, the city would rise up in the air and settle on the sea till the enemy disappeared.  They then sought Kanhadīpāyana's advice and fixed the city down with chains.  This enabled the Andhākavenhudāsaputtā to capture it and make it their capital (J.iv.82ff).  It was also the capital of King Sivi (J.vi.421).  The Petavatthu and its Commentary (Pv.ii.9; PvA.113) speak of Dvāravati as a city of Kamboja.

At one time it was united with the Malayarattha and formed part of the territory governed by the king's second son (E.g., Cv.xli.35; but see Cv.Trs.i.54, n.4).  Later, it seems to have become the special province of the heir-apparent (E.g., Cv.xliii.8; xliv.84; lxv.23; lxviii.33; li.12, etc.).[/p][p]It is also referred to as Dakkhinapassa (E.g., Cv.lviii.41) and Dakkhinabhāga.[/p][p]Among the strongholds of Dakkhinadesa are mentioned Muhunnaru, Badalatthala, Vāpināgara, Buddhagāma, Tilagulla, Mahāgalla and Mandagalla (Cv.lviii.42), and among its villages, Punkhagāma (Cv.lxi.42) and Bodhisenapabbata (Cv.lxi.33).[/p]</e>

The building was evidently attached to the palace "in royal territory," and was originally erected by Devānampiyatissa, its name then being Dhammacakka (Cv.xxxvii.95f).  Dhātusena restored it (Cv.xxxviii.70), while Aggabodhi I.  beautified it with various decorations (Cv.xlii.33).  It was burnt by the Colas, but was rebuilt by Mahinda IV.

Vohāraka-Tissa erected a wall round the monastery (Mhv.vs.35) and Gothābhaya restored the uposatha hall (Mhv.vs.107).  The thera Tissa, for whom Mahāsena built the Jetavana-vihāra, was an incumbent of Dakkhina-vihāra, in this context called Dakkhinārāma (Mhv.xxxvii.32).  Aggabodhi I.  erected a splendid pāsāda in the vihāra (Cv.xlii.14).[/p][p]The vihāra is generally identified with what is now known as Elāra's tomb (But see Cv.Trs.i.66, n.3).[/p]</e>

He also tells Dhammika of various teachers of the past whose disciples, by accepting their teaching, were born in happy states.  A.iii.366ff; the teachers are Sunetta, Mūgapakkha, Aranemi, Kuddālaka and Jotipāla.  These names occur in the Jātakas; see for details.  Perhaps the stories were pre-Buddhistic.

When, at the end of the rains, they tried to break through the web, they failed, and the spider cut off their heads one by one and drank their blood.  This was the end of the Dhatarattha hamsas.

Hot fomentations and the administering of molasses cured the Buddha's complaint.  Devahita came later to the Buddha, and after some conversation he was converted (S.i.174f; DhA.iv.232).  Devahita was said to be a friend of Upavāna (ThagA.i.311f).[/p][p][/p][p]The Samyutta Commentary (SA.i.201) adds that Devahita earned his living from the provision of water heated on his row of ovens and of cosmetics for those who came to bathe.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Devānampiyatissa[/div][p]King of Ceylon (247-207 B.C.).  He was the second son of Mutasīva.  It is said that on the day of his coronation many wonderful treasures miraculously appeared, some of which he resolved to send as tokens of esteem to his contemporary  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asoka,Dhammāsoka')"]Dhammāsoka[/a] of India, with whom he had long been on terms of friendship.  An embassy, led by his nephew Mahārittha, was despatched to  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/paataliputta_gama,Pātaliputta')"]Pātaliputta[/a], and the emperor showed the ambassadors every mark of honour.  He sent back with them all the requisites for a coronation, with instructions to celebrate the inauguration of the Sinhalese king, whom he invited to embrace Buddhism.  On the return of the embassy, the king was solemnly crowned a second time.  This confirmation of Devānampiyatissa's sovereignty under the aegis of Asoka may have been due either to the commanding position of Asoka or for the strengthening of family connections.  Asoka was a Moriyan (a branch of the Sākiyans) and Devānampiyatissa had Sākiyan blood.[/p][p]The chief event in the reign of Devānampiyatissa was the arrival of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mahinda,Mahinda')"]Mahinda[/a] in Ceylon.  He arrived at the head of a mission in the year of the king's second coronation.  Mahinda met the king hunting on the full-moon day of Jettha.  The king welcomed him with great honour and speedily embraced the new religion, to which Asoka had already drawn his attention.  [/p][p]His conversion was the direct result of Mahinda's preaching of the Cūlahatthipadopama Sutta.  His earlier religion is not known, it may have been Jainism.  His example was followed by a large number of his subjects, many of whom entered the Order.  Devānampiyatissa dedicated to their use the Nandana park and the Mahāmeghavana, which he himself had laid out a little earlier.  In the Mahāmeghavana he built the famous Mahā-Vihāra which, for many centuries, remained the centre of the orthodox religion in Ceylon.  The dedication of the Mahā-Vihāra took place in the two hundred and thirty-sixth year after the death of the Buddha.  The king's next pious work was the erection of the Cetiyapabbata-vihāra and he, later, built the Thūpārāma, containing the Buddha's right collar-bone.[/p][p]When the women of the palace, led by Anulā, wife of the sub-king, Mahānāga, expressed a desire to become nuns, Devānampiyatissa sent another embassy to Asoka asking him to send Sanghamittā, together with the right branch of the sacred Bodhi-tree.  This branch miraculously severed itself from the parent tree and, together with Sanghamittā, was conveyed down the Ganges and arrived in Jambukola, where it was received with all honour by Devānampiyatissa.  From Jambukola it was taken in procession to Anurādhapura, where it was planted in the Mahāmeghavana, the king instituting in its honour a festival, which was observed for many centuries.  For the use of Sanghamittā and the nuns the king erected various buildings, the chief of which was the Hatthālhaka-vihāra and the Upāsikā-vihāra with its twelve mansions.  (This account is summarised from the Mahāvamsa (chaps.xi., xiii.-xx.); also Dpv.xi.14ff; xii.7; xvii.92).[/p][p]Among other works of Devānampiyatissa we are told of the building of the Issarasamana- and the Vessagiri-vihāras, the refectory called Mahāpāli, the Jambukola-vihāra in Nāgadīpa, the Tissamahā-vihāra, the Pācīnārāma and the Pathamathūpa.  He also built the Tissavāpi at Anurādhapura.  (The Cv.  (xxxvii.94) mentions also the Dhammacakka as having been built by Devānampiyatissa.  It later became the Temple of the Tooth at Anurādhapura).[/p][p]Mahinda survived him by eight years.  Devānampiyatissa seems to have died without issue, for he was succeeded by four of his brothers.[/p]</e>

He was very dainty as to food, and spent so much on it that he came to be known as Bhojanasuddhika (Dainty-food).  He always ate in a decorated pavilion in full view of his people.  One day, a greedy man seeing him eat and wishing to taste the food, rushed up to him with clasped hands, saying that he was a messenger (dūta), messengers having free access to the king.  Approaching the table, he snatched some food and thrust it into his mouth.  The king's attendants wished to behead him, but the king invited him to share his meal, and, at the conclusion, enquired as to his message.  He said he was the messenger of Lust and of the Belly, and told the king how great was the power of these two.  The king was pleased with him and gave him one thousand cows.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to a greedy monk.  J.ii.318-21.[/p][hr][p][b]2.

He then thought out a plan and sat fasting on the bank of the river, refusing to speak to anybody until the king of Benares himself came.  To him he told his story, pointing out that it would have been useless to tell the others, they being unable to help him.  The king gave him twice the original quantity of gold.[/p][p]The story was related in reference to a discussion by the monks as to the Buddha's great resourcefulness.  J.iv.224-8.[/p]</e>

The sutta is referred to for a description of Avīci (DhA.i.107; also AA.i.21).  It was preached by Mahādeva to the people of Mahisamandala (Mhv.xii.29; Mbv.114), and by Mahinda at Anurādhapura, on the first day of the latter's arrival there, when one thousand people became sotāpannas (Mhv.xiv.63).[/p][p][/p][p]The Majjhima version of the sutta is given (E.g., MA.i.135) as an example of a discourse where the Buddha starts the sermon with a simile and then preaches the Doctrine.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Dīghavāpi[/div][p]A tank and a district in Ceylon.  When the Buddha went to Ceylon he visited the village, and on the spot where he sat in meditation a cetiya was later erected (Mhv.i.78; Dpv.ii.60; Sp.i.89).  It seems to have been the central post in the country lying between the Tamil kingdom and the province of Rohana.  Thus we find Dutthagāmani's brother, Tissa, occupying it by the order of his father.  Later, on the death of his father, he retired to Dīghavāpi with his mother and the elephant Kandula (Mhv.xxiv.2, 14f, 48).  When he made peace with his brother, he was again sent there to look after the district.[/p][p]After the conquest of the Tamils, Tissa was again in charge of Dīghavāpi, for we find him being sent for from there at the time of Dutthagāmani's death (Mhv.xxxii.2).  Tissa (afterwards called Saddhātissa) founded the Dīghavāpi-vihāra, in connection with which he built a cetiya, to which he made valuable offerings (Mhv.xxxiii.9, 14).  We hear of Dīghavāpi in connection with the campaigns of Parakkamabāhu I.  (Cv.lxxiv.89; 98, 110, 180; lxxv.1, 10).  Many years later Rājasīha II.  gave the district round Dīghavāpi to the settlers who came from Holland (Cv.xcvi.25, 28; for its identification see Cv.Trs.ii.30, n.1).  The village of Mahāmuni, residence of Sumanā, wife of Lakuntaka Atimbara, was in Dīghavāpi (DhA.iv.50).

Sāriputta, hearing of his fall from the ways of earnestness - after the death of his first pious wife and his marriage to another - visited Dhānañjāni and pointed out to him that if he departed from equity and righteousness he could not hope to be excused on the plea that his fall was due to force of circumstances.  Dhānañjāni profited by the discourse, and later, when he was ill, he sent word to Sāriputta, told him of his dire illness, and expressed his wish to be born in one of the Brahma-worlds.  Sāriputta taught how union with Brahmā could be attained.  Soon after, Dhānañjāni died, and the Buddha said that he was born in one of the lower Brahma-worlds.  M.ii.184ff.[/p][p][/p][p]2.

His wife encourages him to go.  He goes, has a discussion with the Buddha, and is converted.  Later, he joins the Order and, in due course, becomes an arahant (S.i.159f).[/p][p]Buddhaghosa says (SA.i.175ff) the brahminee was a sotāpanna and that she would constantly sing the praises of the Buddha while engaged in her duties and that the brahmin closed his ears to it.  One day he invited a large number of his friends to a banquet, and, on the eve of the great day, asked her to promise not to offend his brahmin friends by her udāna.  She refused to give any such promise, even when he threatened to cut her with a dagger.  She declared herself ready to suffer, and sang five hundred verses on her theme.  The brahmin surrendered.  While waiting on the guests, her impulse became too great for her, and, laying down bowl and spoon, she started repeating her song of praise.  The scandalised guests hurried away, spitting out the food, defiled by the presence of a heretic, and her husband scolded her for the spoiled feast.  She may be the woman who was responsible for the visit of Sangārava (q.v.) to the Buddha.  The latter is, however, stated to have lived in Candalakappa (M.ii.209).[/p][p][/p][p]3.

Large numbers of Damilas settled in Ceylon, chiefly in the north and east of the Island and, in due course, gained possession of that part of the country.  They were employed as mercenary soldiers by some of the Sinhalese kings and many were brought as captives (E.g., Cv.lxx.230; lxxv.20, 69; lxxviii.76, etc.).  The Damila bhāsā is mentioned among the eighteen non-Aryan languages (E.g., VibhA.388; it was full of consonants, AA.i.409).  In the Akitti Jātaka (J.iv.238) the Damilarattha is spoken of as including also the region round Kāvīrapattana, while in the Petavatthu Commentary (p.133) it is spoken of as part of Dakkhinapātha.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Dasanna[/div][p]A country in Central India.  Rujā was once born as an ox there (J.vi.238).  It was apparently a centre of the art of sword-making (J.iii.338).  Erakaccha, a city in Dasanna, was the residence of the setthi Dhanapāla (Pv.ii.7).  The kings of Dasanna are called Dasannā.  Dasanna is mentioned in the Mahāvastu (i.34) as one of the sixteen mahājanapadas, and also in the Mahābhārata (ii.5-10) and the Meghadūta (24-5).  It is generally identified with Vidisā or the Bhilsa region in the Central Provinces.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Dhammasonda[/div][p]The Bodhisatta born as king of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"]Benares[/a].  He was so called because, at the time of his birth, all beings were filled with a desire for righteousness.  The religion of Kassapa Buddha had disappeared, and D.  was unable to get anyone to preach the Dhamma to him.  He therefore left the kingdom and entered the forest.  By his virtue Sakka's throne was heated, and Sakka, coming down as a Rakkhasa, agreed to preach to D.  if he would allow himself to be eaten.  D.  consented, and, climbing a rock three gāvutas high, threw himself into the Rakkhasa's mouth, listening to his preaching as he fell.  Sakka then revealed his identity, took him to the deva-world and taught him a stanza on impermanence, which had been spoken by Kassapa.  Ras.i.2f.; the story is very popular in Ceylon.[/p]</e>

Parakkamabāhu II., hearing of his great virtues and holiness, sent him offerings of piety, inviting him to Ceylon.  The Elder came and was much honoured by the king (Cv.lxxxiv.11).  It is commonly believed (E.g., J.R.A.S., 1896, pp.202ff) that this was the monk who wrote the continuation of the Mahāvamsa (the Cūlavamsa) dealing with the period from the reign of Mahāsena to that of Parakkamabāhu II.[/p][p][/p][p]3.

This teacher was probably the author of the Pāli poem the Pārāmīmahāsataka.  In addition to the Saddharmālankāra, his pupil wrote several other works, the Sankhepa, the Jinabodhāvalī and the Bālāvatāra; also the Sinhalese chronicle, the Nikāyasangraha.

The Sāsanavamsa (p.33) records that he lived at Badaratittha in South India.  [/p][p]His works show that he was a native of Kāñcipura.  His period is uncertain, though it is generally agreed that he is posterior to Buddhaghosa.  He seems to have studied in the Mahāvihāra, because he mentions this fact in the introduction to his books (e.g., the Petavatthu Commentary).  It is quite likely that he studied the Tamil Commentaries as well and that he wrote at Badaratittha.  (Hiouen Thsang, Beal.ii.229, says that Dhammapāla was a clever youth of Kāñcipura and that the king gave him his daughter.  But Dhammapāla, not wishing to marry, prayed before an image of the Buddha.  The gods took him to a place far away where he was ordained by the monks).  [/p][p]The Khuddaka Nikāya was his chief study, and seven of his works are commentaries on the books of poetry preserved in the Canon - the Thera- and Theri-Gāthā, Udāna, Vimāna- and Peta-Vatthu, Itivuttaka and Cariyāpitaka.  His other works are a commentary on the Netti, and on the Visuddhi-magga (called the Paramatthamañjūsā), tīkās (called Līnatthavannanā) on Buddhaghosa's Commentaries to the Four Nikāyas and another on the Jātakatthakathā.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Dutthagāmanī-Abhaya[/div][p]King of Ceylon (101-77 B.C.) He was the son of Kākavannatissa (ruler of Mahāgāma) and of Vihāradevī, and was called Gāmani-Abhaya.  The antenatal cravings of his mother showed that he would be a great warrior, and his father gathered at his court the most famous warriors of the land skilled in various ways.  Chief among them were Nandhimitta, Sūranimila, Mahāsona, Gothaimbara, Theraputtābhaya, Bharana, Velusumana, Khañjadeva, Phussadeva and Labhiyavasabha.  Abhaya early showed signs of an adventurous disposition, and resented the confined limits of his father's kingdom, bounded on the north by the Mahāvāluka-nadī, on the further bank of which lay the Sinhalese country ruled by the Damilas.  Abhaya was constantly refused permission by his father to fight the Damilas and fled in anger to the hills, whence he sent his royal father a woman's garment, to indicate that he was no man.  This earned for him the nickname of Duttha, which always stuck to him.  At his father's death he had to fight with his brother Tissa (afterwards Saddhā-Tissa) for the possession of the throne.  He was first defeated at Cūlanganiyapitthi, but later he was victorious, and the Sangha brought about a reconciliation between the brothers.  When fully prepared, Dutthagāmani marched against the Damila king, Elāra.  He rode his state elephant, Kandula, born on the same day as himself.  He commenced operations at Mahlyangana, capturing fort after fort, manned by Elāra's followers, and fought his way down to Mahāvāluka-nadī, where he pitched his camp at Kandhāvārapitthi, near Vijitapura, where were concentrated the Damilas.  After a siege of four months Vijitapura fell, and Dutthagāmani advanced through Girilaka and Mahelanagara to Kāsapabbata near Anurādhapura, the capital.  (Mhv.xxv.75. It is said that in the course of his journey from Mahāgāma to Anurādhapura he captured thirty-two fortresses manned by the Damilas).  There he waited for the onset of Elāra and, in the battle that ensued, Elāra was defeated and fled towards the capital, but he was pursued by Dutthagāmani and slain by him in single combat close to the southern gate of the city.  Elāra's body was burnt with royal honours, and Dutthagāmani built a tomb over the ashes and decreed that no music should be played by people passing it, a decree that was for long honoured.  This act of chivalry, so much in contrast with the usual conduct of victors, earned for Dutthagāmani great honour.  Later, he defeated reinforcements from India under Bhalluka, nephew of Elāra, and thus became sole monarch of Lanka.[/p][p]On the seventh day after his final victory, he celebrated a water festival at the Tissavāpi and, at its conclusion, built the Maricavatthi-thūpa (q.v.) on the spot where his spear, containing the relic of the Buddha, given by the monks at Tissamahārāma, remained firmly embedded, no one being able to remove it.  From now onwards, consoled by the arahants of Piyangudīpa, who absolved him from blame for the slaughter of his enemies, he began his great works of piety, after having distributed largesse to his generals and soldiers.  He first built the Lohapāsāda (q.v.) of nine stories, resembling the palace of Bīranī, the plan of which was brought to him from Tusita by arahants.  He then began his greatest achievement, the Mahā Thūpa, erected on a site visited by the Buddha during his third visit to Ceylon.  The devas, led by Sakka, provided the necessary materials, discovered in various parts of the island, and he began work immediately, on the full-moon day of Vesākha.  Great celebrations marked the inauguration of the mighty task, plans of various builders were inspected before the final choice and no free work was allowed to be done.  After the relics, obtained by the arahant Sonuttara from the Nāga-world, had been enshrined in unparalleled splendour and with great feasting, but before the chatta of the cetiya and the plaster work could be finished, Dutthagāmani fell ill.  Saddhā-Tissa was summoned from Dīghavāpi, and he covered the cetiya with white cloth and crowned it with a spire of bamboo, that the king, before his death, might visualize his great work in its complete form.  Theraputtābhaya, a former general, now become an arahant, and living in the Pañjalipabbata, was at the king's side at the time of his death and consoled him with reminders of the great merit he had accumulated during his life.  A record of the king's good deeds was read by his secretary, from which it would appear that the king had erected ninety-nine other vihāras, besides the buildings already mentioned.  He had once tried to preach in the Lohapāsada, but was so overcome by nervousness that, realizing how difficult was the task of the preacher, he ordered special benefactions for those who preached the Doctrine.  Two gifts made by him are recorded as of very special merit - one was the sale of his special earrings to procure food for five theras during the Akkhakkhāyika famine, the other was his gift of food during his flight from Cūlanganiya-pitthi (For details see Mhv.xxxii.49ff; also AA.i.365f).  He was starving, and his minister Tissa procured a meal for him, but as he never ate without offering some of the food to the monks, he wished for a monk to appear before him.  When a thera did so appear, he gave him all he had.  He was told later, on his death bed, by Theraputtābhaya, that this food was divided among many thousands of arahants so that the merits of the donor might increase manifold.[/p][p]It is said that after death Dutthagāmani was born in the Tusita-world, there to await the appearance of Metteyya Buddha.  He will then become the chief disciple of that Buddha, and his parents will be the parents of Metteyya.  Before his birth, as the son of Kākavannatissa, he was a sāmanera of Kotapabbata-vihāra.  He fell ill through his hard work on behalf of the Sangha at the Akāsa-cetiya near Cittalapabbata, and as he lay dying in the Sīlāpassaya-parivena, Vihāradevī visited him at the suggestion of an arahant thera, and after much difficulty persuaded him to be reborn in this world as her son.  (These particulars relating to Dutthagāmanī are summarised from Mhv.  chaps.xxii.-xxxii; Dpv.xviii.53; xix.1ff; Sp.i.102).[/p][p]Dutthagāmanī is regarded as the hero of the Mahāvamsa epic.  His son was Sāliya, who, however, did not succeed him, preferring to marry a candāla maiden, Asokamālā.  Dutthagāmanī's successor, therefore, was Saddhātissa.[/p][p]The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iv.50) mentions a minister of Dutthagāmani called Lakuntaka-atimbara, whose wife was Sumanā.[/p][p]Dutthagāmanī lived to the age of sixty-eight (Mhv.xxiv.47).[/p][p]Once, after his conquest of the Damilas, he was unable to sleep for a whole month, then, at the suggestion of the monks, he took the fast of the eight vows and eight monks chanted to him the Cittayamaka.

He was born at Anupiya in a family of the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mallaa,Mallas')"]Mallas[/a] (Kusinārā, says the Apadāna).  As a child of seven he saw the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"]Buddha[/a] who was visiting in the Malla country, and he asked his grandmother (his mother having died at his birth) if he might join the Order under the Buddha.  She brought him to the Buddha and the boy became an arahant in the Tonsure-hall.  He returned with the Buddha to  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"]Rājagaha[/a] where, with the Buddha's sanction, and wishing to be of service to the Order, he took upon himself the task of appointing night's-lodgings to travelling monks and of directing them to meals.  He performed his duties most diligently and with great intelligence, and his fame spread far and wide.  Monks coming from afar, wishing to witness his skill, would deliberately arrive late and ask for lodgings in some place remote from Rājagaha; Dabba would "burst into flame" and walk ahead of them, with his finger burning to light them on the way.  It was the sight of Dabba on one of these journeys which led to a slave-woman,  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/punnaa,Punnā')"]Punnā[/a], being visited by the Buddha, resulting in her becoming a Sotāpanna (DhA.iii.321ff).[/p][p]It once happened that meals were allotted by Dabba to the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/mettiyabhummajaka,Mettiya-Bhummajakā')"]Mettiya-Bhummajakā[/a] at the house of a rich man, who, discovering their identity, gave orders that they were to be fed anyhow.  The Mettiya-Bhummajakā were greatly offended, and believing that Dabba had intended to slight them, induced one of their partisans, Mettiyā, to accuse Dabba of having seduced her.  The charge was investigated, Mettiyā was expelled, and Dabba's fame increased (Thag.v.5; Vin.ii.74ff; iii.158f, 166f, iv.37f; Sp.iii.598f).  The Mettiya-Bhummajakā persuaded the Licchavi,  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaddha,Vaddha')"]Vaddha[/a], to make a similar charge against Dabba regarding his wife (Vin.ii.124f).  The  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tandulanaali_jat_5,Tandulanāli Jātaka')"]Tandulanāli Jātaka[/a] (J.i.123f ) mentions another dispute, where [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/laludayi_th,Lāludāyi')"]Lāludāyi[/a] charges Dabba with not performing his duties conscientiously.  Thereupon Lāludāyi was appointed to the task, but proved a failure.[/p][p]Dabba was given the rank of chief of those who appointed lodgings (senāsanapaññāpakānam) (A.i.24) and was given the upasampadā ordination when only seven years old.  He was called Dabba because he was said to be born of his mother while she was being burnt in the funeral pyre; when the flames were extinguished, the child was found lying on one of the posts of the pyre (dabbatthambhe) (ThagA.i.41; AA.i.152f).[/p][p]He was a setthiputta in Hamsavatī in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, and it was then that he conceived the desire for the rank of chief apportioner of lodgings.  One hundred and three times he became king among devas and one hundred and five times king of men.  In the time of Vipassī Buddha he spoke calumny about an arahant Thera, hence the conspiracy against him by the Mettiya-Bhummajakā.  In the time of Kassapa Buddha he, with six others, went to the top of a hill, determined not to return till they had accomplished their purpose, but five of them died before this came to pass.  The other four were Pukkusāti, Sabhiya, Bāhiya, and Kumārakassapa (DhA.ii.212; ThagA.i.44ff; Ap.ii.471f; UdA.81; Sp.ii.578f).[/p][p]Dabba evidently died young.  The Udana (Ud.viii.9; UdA.431f ) contains an account of his death.  One day, returning from his alms rounds in Rājagaha, he saw that he had but a short while yet to live.  He went, therefore, to the Buddha and, with his leave, showed various iddhi-powers and passed away.[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Dhaniya[/div][hr][p][b]1. Dhaniya, Dhanika.[/b] A herdsman living on the bank of the river Mahī.  He was a setthiputta of Dhammakonda in Pabbatarattha, which belonged to the kingdom of Videha.  He had thirty thousand oxen and twenty thousand cows.  He had seven sons and seven daughters and numerous retainers.  In the dry season he lived on an island formed by the two forks of the river Mahī, and in the rainy season in a house on the upland.  One day, while he was in this house, having finished his preparations for the approach of the rains, he sat meditating on his comfortable circumstances and broke forth into song in token of his happiness.  The Buddha heard the song at Sāvatthi, seven hundred leagues away, and having travelled through the air, stood over Dhaniya's dwelling.  As Dhaniya proceeded with his song, the Buddha added a verse to each one of Dhaniya's.  At the end of this song Dhaniya, his wife, and two of his daughters, became sotāpannas.  The Buddha then revealed himself and Dhaniya and his wife entered the Order.  Later they became arahants and the cowherds erected for their use a monastery, which came to be called the Gokulanka-vihāra.  SN.vv.18ff; SNA.i.26ff.[/p][hr][p][b]2. Dhaniya.[/b]-A potter of Rājagaha.  In his house the Buddha taught Pukkusāti the Cha-dhātu-vibhanga Sutta.  Dhaniya, hearing that Pukkasāti had died an arahant the same night, was so impressed by the power of the Dhamma, that he entered the Order (Thag.v.228-30; Tha.gA.i.347f).  He once made a grass but on the slopes of Isigili and lived there with several others during the rains.  He continued to live there after the others had left.  While he was away begging for alms, his hut was pulled down by women searching for straw and firewood, but he rebuilt it.  Three times this happened, until, in exasperation, Dhaniya very skilfully made bricks and tiles and built a hut both strong and splendid, with tiles of shining crimson which gave out a bell-like sound when tapped.  The Buddha, seeing this, chided Dhaniya and ordered the hut to be pulled down.  Dhaniya then built a hut of wood which he obtained from a guild of timber merchants, suppliers of wood to the king, giving them to understand that he had the king's permission.  Vassakāra, hearing of this, reported the matter to  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bimbisara,Bimbisāra')"]Bimbisāra[/a], who sent for Dhaniya.  Dhaniya maintained that the king, by royal proclamation, had permitted the monks to use the royal supplies of wood and other materials.  Bimbisāra admitted the proclamation, but said it referred only to supplies straight from the forest, and he sent Dhaniya away with a warning.  The matter created a great uproar and the Buddha blamed Dhaniya.  Vin.iii.41-5; Sp.ii.286.[/p][p]Dhaniya later changed his ways and became an arahant.  In the time of Sikhī Buddha he was a householder and gave the Buddha a reed-chain (? nalamālā).  He is probably identical with Nalamāliya of the Apadāna.  Ap.ii.412.[/p]</e>

Once, during their travels, they came to Nangaraka (Ulumpa says DhA.iii.356) and, hearing that the Buddha was at Medatalumpa, went to see him, but Dīgha stayed outside while the Buddha talked to Pasenadi (M.ii.118f; MA.ii.753f; J.iv.151).  The Dhammapada Commentary (i.355ff) adds that Dīgha went about reviling the king for the murder of his uncle, and that when Pasenadi went in to the Buddha, leaving the royal insignia in Dīgha's charge, the latter saw his chance of revenge.  He left Pasenadi, hastened to Vidūdabha and crowned him king.  He then returned to Sāvatthi, leaving for Pasenadi only a single horse and one female servant.  It was this treachery which led to Pasenadi's untimely death.[/p][hr][p][b]2. Dīgha-Kārāyana.[/b]-A minister of Bhātiya (Bhātikābhaya?).  He was a very learned brahmin and was appointed by the king to settle a dispute between the residents of the Mahāvihāra and the Abhayagiri, regarding the charge brought against Dabba-Mallaputta by the nun Mettiyā.

But, owing to the intervention of Kakusandha, Dūsī's attempts failed and he was born in the Mahā Niraya.

He became a monk under his uncle, the incumbent of Dīghasandasenāpati-parivena, and remained with him till preparations for his campaign were made.  Then he returned to the lay life, killed the Pāndyan, Tiritara, then reigning at Anurādhapura, and became king.  His chief work was the construction of the Kālavāpi, which he carried out by damming the Gonanadī.  He built eighteen vihāras and eighteen tanks.  He showed great favour to the monks and did many works of piety.  The Ambatthala-vihāra he gave to the Dhammarucikas.[/p][p]He had two sons - Moggallāna and Kassapa.  Kassapa rebelled against his father at the instigation of his brother-in-law-who had been punished for ill-treating the king's daughter - and seized Dhātusena in the hope of securing his treasure.  The king asked to be taken to Kālavāpi, saw the Thera who had been his teacher, and announced that his whole treasure was the Kālavāpi.  Kassapa then had him buried alive.[/p][p]Among Dhātusena's gifts is mentioned that of one thousand gold pieces spent by him for an interpretation (?) of the Dīpavamsa (dīpetum Dīpavamsam).

Becoming drowsy, he stumbles over a stone and breaks his thigh.  As his colleagues are on the way to receive their alms at the house of a certain layman they hear his groans, and stopping to minister to him, are prevented from receiving their gifts.

The wife, seeing the Buddha, and fearing that her husband would give away his food, made a sign to the Buddha to go.  But the Buddha made a gesture of refusal and sent a radiance in the direction of the brahmin.  The wife laughed at the Buddha's obstinacy, and, at that moment, the brahmin saw the Buddha and brought to him the remnant of his meal, which the Buddha accepted.  He then preached to the brahmin and his wife, both of whom became anāgāmins.[/p][p]DhA.iv.98 ff.; the story is also found at SNA.i.270, but there the brahmin and his wife only become sotāpannas.[/p]</e>

Later, the Buddha visited the hermitage of Pātikaputta, with a large following, in order to refute his claims, but Pātikaputta avoided him and went to the Tindukhānuparibbājakārāma.  A message was sent to him asking him to come as the Buddha was at his hermitage, but Pātikaputta was unable to arise from his seat.

In his last birth his mother was the daughter of a rich merchant of Sāvatthi.  During her pregnancy, she had a longing to give to five hundred monks, headed by Sāriputta, the choicest portions of red fish, to don yellow robes, to sit in the outer circle of the monks' seats, and to partake of the food left over by the monks.  This longing was satisfied, and seven times she held similar festivities.  When the child was born he was called Pandita because, from the day of his conception, various people of the household who had been stupid or deaf or dumb recovered their faculties.  When seven years old, he was filled with the desire to become a monk, and was ordained by Sāriputta, a constant visitor to the house.  For seven days his parents held a festival in honour of his ordination.  On the eighth day he went, with Sāriputta, into the village for alms; on the way, certain things which he saw - a ditch, arrow makers, carpenters - made him wish to strive for arahantship.  Thereupon, with the leave of Sāriputta, he returned to the monastery requesting the Elder to bring him some red fish on his return from the alms round.  In the monastery, Sakka stilled all noises and held back the sun and the moon, lest Pandita should be disturbed.  The Buddha, seeing this, detained Sāriputta back on his way to the monastery, and engaged him in conversation until Pandita should have succeeded in his effort.  After a while, Pandita became an arahant and the whole world rejoiced.  Ibid., ii.139ff.[/p][hr][h4]3. Pandita[/h4][p]A Pacceka Buddha, mentioned in a nominal list.

When her parents wished to marry her to a youth of her own rank, she ran away with her lover and lived in a hamlet.  As the time for her confinement drew near, she wished to return to her parents, but the husband, on various pretexts, put off the visit.  One day when he was out she left a message with the neighbours and started for Sāvatthi.  Her husband followed her, but on the way she gave birth to a son, and they returned home.  The same happened when her second child was born, but soon after its birth a great storm broke, and her husband went to cut some sticks and grass in the jungle with which to make a shelter.  He was bitten by a snake and died.[/p][p]The wife spent the night in misery, lying on the ground hugging her children.  In the morning she discovered her husband's body, and started off to go to her parents.  On the way she had to cross a river, and, because it was in flood, she could not carry both her children across at the same time.  She therefore left the younger on some leaves on the bank and started wading across with the other.  In midstream she looked back and saw a hawk swoop down and carry away the babe.  In her excitement she dropped the child she was carrying and it was swept away by the flood.  Distracted, she went on towards Sāvatthi, but on the way she learnt that the house in which her parents and brother lived had fallen on them in the night and that they had been burnt on one pyre.

Pacceka Buddhas practise their  [a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/n_r/paramii,pāramī')"]pāramī[/a] for at least two thousand asankheyya [a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/g_m/kappa,kappas')"]kappas[/a].  They are born in any of the three kulas: brāhmana, khattiya, or gahapati only in a vivattamāna kappa, during which Buddhas are also born, but they never meet a Buddha face to face.

They do ordain others; their admonition is only in reference to good and proper conduct (abhisamācārikasikkhā).  [/p][p]Sometimes (e.g., at J.iv.341) it is stated that a Pacceka Buddha's knowledge and comprehension of ways and means is less than that of a Bodhisatta.  They hold their uposatha in the Ratanamālaka, at the foot of the Mañjūsarukkha in Gandhamādana.  It is possible to become a Pacceka Buddha while yet a layman, but, in this case, the marks of a layman immediately disappear.  Three caves in the Nandamūlakapabbhāra - Suvannaguhā, Maniguhā and Rajataguhā - are the dwelling places of Pacceka Buddhas.  Round the Ratanamālaka, q.v.  (or Sabbaratanamālaka), seats are always ready to receive the Pacceka Buddhas.  When a Pacceka Buddha appears in the world, he immediately seeks the Ratanamālaka, and there takes his appointed seat.  Then all the other Pacceka Buddhas in the world assemble there to meet him, and, in reply to a question by the chief of them, he relates the circumstances which led to his enlightenment.  Similarly, all the Pacceka Buddhas assemble at the same spot when one of them is about to die.  The dying one takes leave of the others, and, after his death, they cremate his body and his relics disappear.  These details are given in SNA.i.47, 51, 58, 63; KhA.178, 199; ApA.i.125; see also s.v.  Gandhamādana.[/p][p]But, according to another account, they die on the mountain called Mahāpapāta (q.v.).  There does not seem to be any limit to the number of Pacceka Buddhas who could appear simultaneously.  In one instance, five hundred are mentioned as so doing, all sons of Padumavatī (q.v.), at the head of whom was Mahāpaduma.  In the Isigili Sutta (M.iii.68ff ) appears a long list of Pacceka Buddhas who dwelt on the Isigili Mountain (q.v.), and after whom the mountain was named.[/p][p]According to Buddhaghosa (MA.ii.889ff), the names in this list belonged to the five hundred sons of Padumavatī, but the number of the names is far less than five hundred.  This discrepancy is explained by saying that as many as twelve bore the same name.  Other names are found scattered over different texts, such as the Jātakatthakathā.  E.g., Darīmukha (J.iii.240), Sonaka (v.249); see also DhA.  iv.120, etc.  [/p][p]The name occurring most frequently in the texts is that of Tagarasikhī (q.v.).  Mention is also made of the Pacceka Buddhas going among men for alms and spending the rainy season in dwellings provided by men.  E.g., DhA.ii.112f.; iii.91, 368; iv.200. Their patthanā (SNA.51).  Their wisdom less than that of a Bodhisatta (J.iv.341).[/p][p]Among the teachings preserved of the Pacceka Buddhas, the most important is the Khaggavisāna Sutta (q.v.).  For the definition of a Pacceka Buddha see Puggalapiññatti (p.14; cf.  p.70).  There he is described as one who understands the Truth by his own efforts, but does not obtain omniscience nor mastery over the Fruits (phalesu vasībhāvam).[/p][p]See also Mātanga (2).[/p]</e>

The Buddha prophesied the future greatness of Pātaligāma, and also mentioned the danger of its destruction by fire, water, or internal discord.  The gate by which the Buddha left the town was called Gotamadvāra, and the ferry at which he crossed the river, Gotamatittha (Vin.i.226 30; D.ii.86ff).[/p][p]The date at which Pātaliputtta became the capital is uncertain.   [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hiuen_tsang,Hiouen Thsang')"]Hiouen Thsang[/a] seems to record (Beal: Records ii.85, n.  11) that it was Kālāsoka who moved the seat of government there.  The Jains maintain that it was Udāyi, son of Ajātasattu (Vin.  Texts ii.102, n.  1).  The latter tradition is probably correct as, according to the Anguttara Nikāya (iii.57) even Munda is mentioned as residing at Pātaliputta.  It was, however, in the time of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asoka,Asoka')"]Asoka[/a] that the city enjoyed its greatest glory.  In the ninth year of his reign Asoka's income from the four gates of the city is said to have been four hundred thousand kahāpanas daily, with another one hundred thousand for his sabhā or Council (Sp.i.52).[/p][p]The city was known to the Greeks as Pālibothra, and Megasthenes, who spent some time there, has left a vivid description of it (Buddhist India 262f).  It continued to be the capital during the greater part of the Gupta dynasty, from the fourth to the sixth century A.C.  Near Pātaliputta was the Kukkutārāma, where monks (e.g.  Ananda, Bhadda and Nārada) stayed when they came to Pātaliputta (M.i.349; A.v.341; A.iii.57; S.v.15f., 171f).  At the suggestion of Udena Thera, the brahmin Ghotamukha built an assembly ball for the monks in the city (M.ii.163).[/p][p]Pātaligāma was so called because on the day of its foundation several pātali shoots sprouted forth from the ground.  The officers of Ajātasattu and of the Licchavi princes would come from time to time to Pātaligāma, drive the people from their houses, and occupy them themselves.  A large hall was therefore built in the middle of the village, divided into various apartments for the housing of the officers and their retainers when necessary.  The Buddha arrived in the village on the day of the completion of the building, and the villagers invited him to occupy it for a night, that it might be blessed by his presence.  On the next day they entertained the Buddha and his monks to a meal (Ud.viii.6; UdA.407ff).[/p][p]Pātaliputta was also called Pupphapura (Mhv.iv.31, etc.; Dpv.xi.28) and Kusamapura (Mbv.p.153).  The journey from Jambukola, in Ceylon, to Pātaliputta took fourteen days, seven of which were spent on the sea voyage to Tāmalitti (E.g., Mhv.xi.24).  The Asokārāma built by Asoka was near Pātaliputta (Mhv.xxix.36).  The Buddha's water pot and belt were deposited in Pātaliputta after his death (Bu.xxviii.9).  The Peta Vatthu Commentary (p.271) mentions that trade was carried on between Pātaliputta and  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suvannabhuumi,Suvannabhūmi')"]Suvannabhūmi[/a].[/p]</e>

His doctrine is, therefore, one of non action (akiriya vāda).  When one, with a sharp sword, cleaves a head in twain, no one is thereby deprived of life, a sword has merely penetrated into the interval between seven elementary substances (cf.  the doctrine of the Cartesians, that there is no sin in taking the life of lower animals because they have no soul).

This is evidence of the ascetic tendency in his teaching on matters of external conduct.  His teaching is, however, described as nissirikaladdhi.[/p][p]We are told (M.i.250; ii.4) that Pakudha's followers did not hold him in high esteem, in contrast to the devotion felt for the Buddha by his followers.  Pakudha did not welcome questions, and displayed annoyance and resentment when cross examined.  Elsewhere (E.g., M.i.198; S.i.66; SN.p.91) however, he is spoken of as having been highly honoured by the people, a teacher of large and well reputed schools, with numerous followers.

The Buddha went there from Sāvatthi, knowing it to be the best place in which to meet them.  Bāvarī's disciples followed him thither.  The cetiya was originally a shrine dedicated to some divinity (devatthāna) and built on a great rock, hence its name.  Later, it was converted into a vihāra for the Buddha, being within easy reach of the town.  Sakka built there a great hall (mandapa) for the Buddha (SNA.  583, 584).

  <e>[div class="huge"]Pamsukūlī, Pamsukūlino, Pamsukūlikā[/div][p]A sect of ascetics in Ceylon, whose particular observance was probably the use of rag robes (pamsukūla).  Their early origin is not known, Mānavamma is said to have built for them a pāsāda in the Thūpārāma (Cv.xlvii.66).  They also occupied the Rājamātika vihāra and enjoyed the special favour of both Aggabodhi V.  and of Aggabodhi VII (Ibid., xlviii.4, 16, 73).  Vajira, senāpati of Aggabodhi IX., built for them the Kacchavāla vihāra (Ibid., xlix.80).  Sena I.  established for them headquarters on the Arittha pabbata and also made special provision for them at Pulatthipura (Ibid., l.63, 76).  [/p][p]They seem to have originally belonged to the congregation of the Abhayagiri vihāra, and continued to do so up to the reign of Sena II., when they separated off and formed special groups (Ibid., li.52).  Later, Sena Ilanga, general of Kassapa IV., built the Samuddagiri parivena, in the Mahā vihāra for their use, and it is said that he dispensed rice and clothing to the mothers of the Pamsukulikas (Ibid., Iii.21).  [/p][p]In the time of Udaya III.  various officials of the court fled to the tapovana occupied by the Pamsukulikas, but were pursued thither by the king and his viceroy and beheaded.  Incensed by this act, the Pamsukulikas left the tapovana, which stood on land granted by the king, and went to Rohana.  The people rose in rebellion, and those who had perpetrated the crime in the tapovana visited the Pamsukulikas in Rohana, asked their forgiveness, and persuaded them to return (Ibid., Iiii.14ff., 21ff).  Mahinda IV.  also showed them great honour (Ibid., liv.18, 24f).  We hear of them last in the reign of Vikkamabāhu II., when that king deprived them of their lands, and they, in anger, retired again to Rohana (Ibid., lxi.59f).  Thenceforth we hear no more of the sect, and it probably ceased to exist.[/p][p]It is mentioned in the Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.52f ) that, after the depredations of Candāla Tissa, when the religion was at a very low ebb, a discussion arose between the Pamsukulikas and the Dhammakathīkas as to which was the more important branch of the sāsana pariyatti or patipatti.

When the chief disciple returned and heard of this, he tried to explain matters to them, but they would not hearken until the Bodhisatta himself appeared from the Brahmaworld and convinced them of their folly.

He was considered a favourite of the Buddha (DA.iii.699), and when Sakka visited the Buddha at the Indasālaguhā in order to ask him certain questions, he sent Pañcasikha in advance, that he might obtain permission for the interview.  The episode in given in full in the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakkapanha_sutta,Sakkapañha Sutta')"]Sakkapañha Sutta[/a] (D.ii.263ff.).[/p][p]Pañcasikha approached the Buddha and playing on his vinā, sang of the beauties of the Buddha, the Doctrine, Arahants and Love.  The verses really formed a love poem addressed to his beloved, Bhaddā Suriyavaccasā, daughter of the Gandhabba Timbarū.  The Buddha praised his music and song and questioned him about the poem.  He confessed that when the Buddha was staying under the Ajapāla nirgodba, before the Enlightenment, he (Pañcasikha) had met Suriyavaccasā going with her father to dance before Sakka.  Pañcasikha thereupon fell in love with her; but she favoured the suit of Sikhandi, son of Mātali.  Pañcasikha thereupon composed a song, which he sang to her.  She was greatly pleased with the references in the song to the Sākyan sage of whom she had heard when she went to the Sudhammāsabhā, (on this occasion Sakka, pronounced his 8 fold eulogy of the Buddha, contained in the Mahāgovinda Sutta, says Buddhaghosa, DA.ii.704) and she consented to marry Pañcasikha.  It is said that Sakka blessed the marriage in return for Pañcasikha's intercession with the Buddha on his behalf.[/p][p]In the Janavasabha Sutta (D.ii.211; also in the Mahāgovinda Sutta, D.ii.230) it is stated that when Brahmā Sanankumāra appeared before the assembly of the gods of Tāvatimsa and materialized himself he assumed the form of Pañcasikha.  Buddhaghosa says (DA.ii.640), by way of explanation, that all the devas loved Pañcasikha and wished to resemble him.  In the Mahāgovinda Sutta (D.i.220; cp.  Mtu.iii.197ff) Pañcasikha is represented as conveying to the Buddha a full report of the happenings in the assembly of the devas, when Sakka spoke the Buddha's praises.[/p][p]No really satisfactory explanation is found in the Commentaries of Pañcasikha's name.  Buddhaghosa says (DA.ii.647) Pañcasikho ti pañcacūlo, pañcakundaliko, and goes on to say that Pañcasikha was born once as a human being, and, while yet a boy wearing his hair in five knots* (pañcacūlakadāraka kāle), he became chief of those who tended the calves.  [/p][p]* This is done even now in Ceylon, where young boys' hair is tied round their heads in several knots.  But in one place (DA.i.296) Buddhaghosa says that one way of insulting a man was to shave his head, leaving him five locks of hair (garahāyā ti pañcasikhā mundakaranam).  And, again (SA.i.171), he mentions that Sanankumāra retained his eternal youth because in a previous life he had developed jhāna while yet a lad (pañcasikhakumārakāle).  See also J.vi.496, where a traitor had his hair tied in five knots as a sign of disgrace.[/p][p]Together with other lads he engaged in works of public utility, such as repairing roads, digging wells, building rest houses, etc., and he died while young.  He was reborn in the Cātummahārājika world, destined to live for ninety thousand years, his body three gāvutas in height.  He wore on his person one hundred cartloads of ornaments and rubbed nine pots of perfume on his body.  He wore red robes, and on his head a chaplet of red gold, round which his hair was arranged in five locks (kuntalikehi), which fell back as in the case of a young boy (pañcacūli-kadārakaparihāren'eva).[/p][p]It was Pañcasikha who first received from the king of the Cātummahārājika worlds and their ministers reports of good deeds done by human beings.  These he would pass on to Mātali, who, in his turn, presented them to Sakka (DA.ii.650).  On the day of the Devorohana, when the Buddha descended from Tāvatimsa, Pañcasikha was present to render honour to the Teacher in song and music (DhA.iii.225; AA.i.72; Vsm.392).  According to the legends (E.g., Mhv.xxx.75; xxxi.82) he was present with the Buddha on other occasions as well.[/p][p]Pañcasikha was evidently not only the name of a person, but also of an office (like Sakka), for in the Bilārakosiya Jātaka (q.v.) Ananda is said to have been born as Pañcasikha and to have helped Sakka and others to make of Bīlārakosiya a generous man (J.iv.69).  Similarly, in the Sudhābhojana Jātaka (q.v.), Anuruddha is identified with Pañcasikha.  J.v.412.[/p]</e>

Buddhaghosa says (AA.ii.758) he was one of the three leaders of the Asuras, the others being Vepacitti and Rāhu.  He first conceived a wish to see the Buddha on the day of the Enlightenment; but this wish was not fulfilled until eleven years later, when he visited the Buddha at Verañjā.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Pabbhāravāsī Tissa Thera[/div][p]Having received a topic of meditation from the Buddha, he went into the forest.  Seeing a cave, he dwelt there, a woman from the neighbouring village supplying him with food.  The deity in the cave found the Elder's presence inconvenient, but could think of no excuse for asking him to go away, his life having been spotless.  But after much thinking, she hit upon a plan; she took possession of the body of the youngest son of the woman who supplied the Elder, and wrung his neck, telling the mother that he would be cured if she could get certain things from the Elder as medicine.  This the woman refused to do, but, in the end, she consented to throw on the head of her son, with the Elder's permission, the water used for washing the latter's feet.  When the Elder returned to his cave the deity addressed him as "physician." He could not understand this until she had told him the story.  Then realizing how blameless his life had been, he was filled with joy and attained arahantship.  But because the deity had tried to bring calumny on him, he asked her to leave the forest.

[/p][p]Pāvā was evidently a centre of Buddhist activity even during the lifetime of the Buddha, and mention is made of Pāveyyaka monks in the Vinaya (E.g., Vin.i.253).  During the time of the Vajjiputta heresy, it was the Pāveyyakā who upheld the true doctrine, their leaders being Revata, Sambhūta Sānavāsī, Yasa Kākandakaputta and Sumana (Vin.ii.301ff.; Mhv.iv.17ff).  In this connection the Pāveyyakā are also described as "Pacchimikā" in opposition to the Vajjiputtakas who are called "Pācīnakā." [/p][p]It is explained (E.g., MT.166) that the Pāveyyakā were called "Pacchimikā" because they lived to the west.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Pātimokkha[/div][p]The name given to a set of two hundred and twenty seven rules to be observed by members of the Buddhist Order.  The rules are not ethical but mainly economic, regulating the behaviour of the members of the Order towards one another in respect of clothes, dwellings, furniture, etc., held in common.  In four cases out of the two hundred and twenty seven the punishment for infringement of a rule is exclusion from the Order; in all the remaining cases, it is merely suspension for a time.[/p][p]The rules are arranged in seven sections [/p][ul][li]Pārajikā Dhammā[/li][li] [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/s4_sap,Sanghādisesā')"]Sanghādisesā[/a]-pātimokkha[/li][li]Aniyatā[/li][li]Nissaggiyāpācittiyā[/li][li]Pācittiyā-pātimokkha[/li][li]Patidesanīyā[/li][li]Sekkiyā pātimokkha[/li][/ul][p]corresponding very roughly to the degree of weight attached to their observance.  [/p][p]The Pātimokkha is not included in the extant Buddhist Canon.  The rules are included, in the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vibhanga,Sutta Vibhanga')"]Sutta Vibhanga[/a] ("sutta" here meaning "rule"), which contains besides the rules themselves, an old Commentary explaining them and a new Commentary containing further supplementary information concerning them.  The rules are divided into two parts: one for the monks (Bhikkhu Pātimokkha) and the other for the nuns (Bhikkhuknī Pātimokkha).  It is a moot point whether the rules originally appeared with the explanatory notes (as in the Vibhanga), the Pātimokkha being subsequently extracted, or whether the Pātimokkha alone was the older portion, the additional matter of the Vibhanga being the work of a subsequent revision.  For a discussion of this, see Vin.i.  Introd.xvi; Law: Pāli.  Lit.  2ff.; Hastings: Encyclopaedia under Pātimokkha.[/p][p]It is sometimes suggested (Law: op.  cit., p.2) that the original number of Pātimokkha rules numbered only about one hundred and fifty.  A passage in the Anguttara Nikāya (i.231-232) is quoted in support of this suggestion (sādhikam diyaddhasikkhāpadasatam).  According to this theory the seventy five Sekhiyā rules were added later.  See Law: op.  cit., 19f.; Law's argument, however, that the Pātimokkha rules were among the texts not recited at the First Council, is due to a wrong understanding of the Sumangala Vilāsinī passage (i.17).  [/p][p]The rules were recited at the gatherings of members of the Order (the Uposatha khandha of the Mahā Vagga (Vin.i.101 36) gives details of the procedure at these gatherings) in their respective districts on uposatha days (the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month).  Each section of the rules is recited and, at the end of such recital, the reciter asks the members of the Order who are present if any one of them has infringed any of the rules.  Silence implies absence of guilt.  This practice of interrupting the recital seems to have been changed later (see Vin.ii.240 ff.) even though the old formula, asking the members to speak, continued as a part of the recital.[/p][p]The word pātimokkha is variously explained, the oldest explanation being that the observance of the rules is the face (mukham), the chief (pamukham) of good qualities.  The Sanskritised form of the word being prātimoksa, this led to a change in its significance, the completion of the recital being evidence that all those who have taken part are pure in respect of the specified offences - pātimokkha thus meaning acquittal, deliverance or discharge.  But in most contexts the word simply means code - i.e., code of verses for the members of the Order.[/p][p]For a detailed account of the Pātimokkha rules see Law: Pāli Literature, 49 ff.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Pandū[/div][p]A nation in South India, the Pandiyas.  Their country comprised the greater part of the Madura and Tinnevelly, with its capital first at Kolkai and later at Madhurā.  [/p][p]Ceylon was inconstant communication with this country, both peaceful and otherwise.  Marauding bands of Pandūs often came to Ceylon and, having deposed the rightful sovereign, ruled over the country.  Chief among these invasions were the following: (a) for fourteen years, when Vattagāmani lay in hiding; (b) for twenty seven years, after the death of Mahānāma and until Dhātusena established his authority; (c) in the time of Sena I.; (d) after the death of Mahinda V.  They also came with Māgha and Candabhānu, and, later, with Āryacakkavattin, who succeeded in carrying the Tooth Relic away to the Pāndyan court; this was later rescued by Parakkamabāhu III.  Sometimes the Singhalese kings would make reprisals by invading the Pāndyan territory e.g., in the reign of Sena II., and, perhaps also, under Nissanka Malla.  Parakkamabāhu I.  sent an army under his general Lankāpura to help the Pāndyan king Parākrama Pāndya against the Cola king, Kulasekhara.  This, according to the Mahāvamsa account, brought great joy to the Singhalese.[/p][p]Mention is made in the chronicles of several marriages between members of the Pāndyan and the Singhalese royal families.  Vijaya himself took his consort from the Pāndyan king at Madhurā, and later, Mittā, sister of Vijayabāhu I., married a Pāndyan prince who became the grandfather of Parakkamabāhu 1. This led to the establishment of a "Pāndyan party" in Ceylon which was not always loyal to the reigning monarch e.g., in the case of Vikkamabāhu III.  Parakkama Pandu, who deposed Līlāvati, evidently belonged to this party and probably also Vijaya III.  The Pāndyan kings claimed descent from the Lunar race.  [/p][p]Codrington, op.  cit., 15.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Pasenadi[/div][p]King of Kosala and contemporary of the Buddha.  He was the son of Mahā Kosala, and was educated at Takkasilā where, among his companions, were the Licchavi Mahāli and the Malla prince Bandhula.  On his return home his father was so pleased with his proficiency in the various arts that he forthwith made him king.  (DhA.i.338; for his genealogy see Beal: Records ii.2, n.  3).[/p][p]As ruler, Pasenadi gave himself wholeheartedly to his administrative duties (*2) and valued the companionship of wise and good men (*3).  Quite early in the Buddha's ministry, (*4) Pasenadi became his follower and close friend, and his devotion to the Buddha lasted till his death.[/p][hr][p](*2) E.g., S.i.74, 100; the Commentary (SA i.109f.) adds that the king tried to put down bribery and corruption in his court, but his attempt does not appear to have been very successful.[/p][p](*3) Thus he showed his favour to Pokkharasādi and Cankī, by giving them, respectively, the villages of Ukkatthā and Opasāda free of all taxes.  It is said that his alms halls were always open to everyone desiring food or drink (Ud.ii.6).  Even after becoming the Buddha's follower, he did not omit to salute holy men of other persuasions (Ud.vi.2).[/p][p](*4) According to Tibetan sources, Pasenadi's conversion was in the second year of the Buddha's ministry (Rockhill, p.49).  We find the king referring to the Buddha, at their first meeting, as being young in years (S.i.69).  Their first meeting and conversation, which ended in Pasenadi's declaring himself an adherent of the Buddha, are recorded in the Dahara Sutta (q.v.).[/p][hr][p]But Pasenadi's conversion did not prevent him from extending his favour, with true Indian toleration, to the members of other religious orders.  Mention is even made of a great animal sacrifice which he once prepared, but which he abandoned on the advice of the Buddha, whom he sought at Mallika's suggestion (*5).  He frequently visited the Buddha and discussed various matters with him (*6).  The whole of the Third Samyutta (Kosala Saipyutta), consisting of twenty five anecdotes, each with a moral bias, is devoted to him.  The topics discussed are many and varied.  The Buddha and Pasenadi were equals in age, and their talks were, therefore, intimate and frank (*7).  [/p][hr][p](*5) S.i.75; for details see the Mahāsupina and Lohakumbhi Jātakas.  It is said (SA.i.111) that the king fell in love with a woman while riding round the city; on discovering that she was married, he ordered her husband to go, before sunset, and fetch clay and lilies from a pond one hundred leagues away.  When the man had gone, the king ordered the gatekeepers to shut the gates early and not on any account to open them.  The husband returned in the evening, and finding the gates shut, went to Jetavana, to seek protection from the king's wrath.  The king spent a sleepless night owing to his passion and had bad dreams.  When the brahmins were consulted they advised a great animal sacrifice.  The story is also found at DhA.ii.1ff., with several variations in detail.[/p][p](*6) It is said that he went three times a day to wait on the Buddha, sometimes with only a small bodyguard.  Some robbers, knowing this, arranged an ambush in the Andhavana.  But the king discovered the plot, of which he made short work.[/p][p](*7) Pasenadi was extremely attached to the Buddha, and the books describe how, when he saw the Buddha, he bowed his head at the Buddha's feet, covering them with kisses and stroking them (M.ii.120).  The Chinese records say (Beal,xliv) that when the Buddha went to Tāvatimsa, Pasenadi made an image of the Buddha in sandalwood, to which he paid honour.  He was very jealous of the Buddha's reputation, and put down with a firm hand any attempt on the part of heretics to bring discredit on him - e.g., in the case of Sundarī Nandā (q.v.).  In the Aggañña Sutta (D.iii.83f.), the Buddha explains why Pasenadi honours him.  For Pasenadi's own explanation as to why people honoured the Buddha even more than the king, see M.ii.123; see also A.v.65 ff.  Pasenadi was also jealous of the reputation of the Order, and if anything arose which seemed likely to bring discredit on it, he took prompt steps to have the matter remedied - e.g., in the case of Kundadhāna (q.v.) and Kumāra Kassapa's mother (q.v.).  Pasenadi's palace overlooked the Aciravati, and when he once saw some monks sporting in the river in an unseemingly way, he made sure that the Buddha knew of it (Vin.iv.112).  The story of the blind man and the elephant shows that he was anxious to justify the Buddha's teaching as against that of other sects (SNA.ii.529).[/p][hr][p]On one occasion we find the Buddha telling him to eat less and teaching his nephew Sudassana (or Uttara) a verse on the advantages of moderation, to be repeated to the king whenever he sat down to a meal.  This advice was followed and the king became slim.  [/p][blockquote][p]S.i.81; DhA.iii.264f.; iv.6f.; the Samyutta Commentary (SA.i.136) states that the bowl out of which he ate (paribhogapāti) was the size of a cartwheel.  Pasenadi was always conscious of his own dignity - e.g., the incident with Chattapāni (q.v.); but see Vin.iv.157f., which probably refers to the same story.[/p][/blockquote][p]Pasenadi's chief consort was Mallikā, daughter of a garland maker (see  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mallikaa,Mallikā')"]Mallikā[/a] for details of her marriage with the king).  He loved her dearly and trusted her judgment in all things.  When in difficulty he consulted her, realizing that her wisdom was greater than his own (E.g., in the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asadisadaana,Asadisadāna')"]Asadisadāna[/a]).  There is an account given (S.i.74) of Pasenadi seeking a confession from her that she loved him more than her own soul (attā) as a confirmation of their mutual trust.  But the queen was pious and saw into the reality of things, and declared that nothing was dearer to her than her own soul.  Piqued by this answer, Pasenadi sought the Buddha, who comforted him by explaining the true import of Mallikā's words.  On another occasion, Pasenadi expressed to the Buddha his disappointment that Mallikā should have borne him a daughter instead of a son; but the Buddha pointed out to him that there was much, after all, to be said for daughters (S.i.83).[/p][p]Mallikā predeceased Pasenadi (A.iii.57); he had also other wives, one of them being the sister of Bimbisāra, (*14) and another Ubbirī (q.v.).  The Kannakatthala Sutta (M.ii.125) mentions two others who were sisters: Somā and Sakulā.  (*16)[/p][hr][p](*14) DhA.i.385; Pasenadi's relations with Bimbisāra were very cordial.  Bimbisāra had five millionaires in his kingdom Jotiya, Jatila, Mendaka, Punnaka and Kākavaliya while Pasenadi had none.  Pasenadi therefore visited Bimbisāra and asked for one to be transferred to him.  Bimbisāra gave him Dhanañjaya, Mendaka's son, and Pasenadi settled him in Sāketa (DhA.i.385ff).[/p][p](*16) In the Samyutta Nikāya (v.  351), the king's chamberlains, Isidatta and Purāna, speak of his harem.  When he went riding in the park he took with him his favourite and lovely wives on elephants, one before and one behind.  They were sweetly scented "like caskets of scent" and their hands were soft to the touch.[/p][hr][p]It is stated that Pasenadi wished to associate himself with the Buddha's family so that their relationship might be even closer.  For seven days he had given alms to the Buddha and one thousand monks, and on the seventh day he asked the Buddha to take his meals regularly at the palace with five hundred monks; but the Buddha refused the request and appointed Ananda to take his place.  Ananda came daily with five hundred others, but the king was too busy to look after them, and the monks, feeling neglected, failed to come any more, only Ananda keeping to his undertaking.  When the king became aware of this he was greatly upset, and determined to win the confidence of the monks by marrying a kinswoman of the Buddha.  He therefore sent messages to the Sākyan chiefs, who were his vassals, asking for the hand of one of their daughters.  The Sākyans discussed the proposition in their Mote-Hall, and held it beneath the dignity of their clan to accede to it.  But, unwilling to incur the wrath of their overlord, they sent him Vāsabha khattiyā, daughter of Mahānāma and of a slave woman, Nāgamundā.  By her, Pasenadi had a son Vidūdabha.  When the latter visited Kapilavatthu, he heard by chance of the fraud that had been practised on his father and vowed vengeance.  When he came to the throne, he invaded the Sākyan territory and killed a large number of the clan without distinction of age or sex (DhA.i.339ff.; J.i.133f.; iv.144ff).  It is said that when Pasenadi heard of the antecedents of Vāsabhakhattiyā, he withdrew the royal honours, which had been bestowed on her and her son and reduced them to the condition of slaves.  But the Buddha, hearing of this, related to Pasenadi the Katthahārika Jātaka, and made him restore the royal honors to the mother and her son.  Mention is made of another son of Pasenadi, named Brahmadatta, who entered the Order and became an arahant.[/p][p]ThagA.i.460; the Dulva says that Jeta, owner of Jetavana, was also Pasenadi's son (Rockhill, p.48).[/p][p]Pasenadi's sister, Kosaladevī, was married to Bimbisāra.  Mahākosala gave her a village in Kāsi as part of her dowry, for her bathmoney.  When Ajātasattu killed Bimbisāra, Kosaladevī died of grief, and Pasenadi confiscated the Kāsi village, saying that no patricide should own a village which was his by right of inheritance.  Angered at this, Ajātasattu declared war upon his aged uncle.  At first, victory lay with Ajātasattu, but Pasenadi had spies who reported to him a plan of attack suggested by the Thera Dhanuggaha Tissa, in the course of a conversation with his colleague Mantidatta, and in the fourth campaign Pasenadi took Ajātasattu prisoner, and refused to release him until he renounced his claim to the throne.  Upon his renunciation, Pasenadi not only gave him his daughter Vajirā in marriage, but conferred on her, as a wedding gift, the very village in dispute (J.ii.237, 403; iv.342f).[/p][p]Three years later, Vidūdabha revolted against his father.  In this he was helped by the commander in chief, Dīghakārāyana, nephew of Bandhula (q.v.).  Bandhula, chief of the Mallas, disgusted with the treachery of his own people, had sought refuge with his former classmate, Pasenadi, in Sāvatthi.  Bandhula's wife, Mallikā, bore him thirty two sons, brave and learned.  Pasenadi, having listened to the tales of his corrupt ministers, contrived to have Bandhula and all his sons killed while they were away quelling a frontier rebellion.  BandhuIa's wife was a devout follower of the Buddha's faith, and showed no resentment against the king for this act of treachery.  This moved the king's heart, and he made all possible amends.  But Dīghakārāyana never forgave him, and once when Pasenadi was on a visit to the Buddha at Medatalumpa (Ulumpa), leaving the royal insignia with his commanderin chief, Dīghakārāyana took advantage of this opportunity, withdrew the king's bodyguard, leaving behind only one single horse and one woman servant, hurried back to the capital and crowned Vidūdabha king.  When Pasenadi heard of this, he hurried on to Rājagaha to enlist Ajātasattu's support; but as it was late, the city gates were closed.  Exhausted by his journey, he lay down in a hall outside the city, where he died during the night.[/p][p]When Ajātasattu heard the news, he performed the funeral rites over the king's body with great pomp.  He wished to march at once against Vidūdabha, but desisted on the advice of his ministers (M.ii.118; MA.ii.753ff.; DhA.i.353ff.; J.iv.150ff).[/p][p]Pasenadi had a sister, Sumanā, who was present at his first interview with the Buddha and decided to enter the Order, but she delayed doing so as she then had to nurse their aged grandmother.  Pasenadi was very fond of his grandmother, and was filled with grief when she died in her one hundred and twentieth year.  After her death, Sumanā became a nun and attained arahantship (ThigA.22; S.i.97; A.iii.32).  The old lady's possessions were given over to the monks, the Buddha giving special permission for them to be accepted (Vin.ii.169).[/p][p]Among the king's most valued possessions was the elephant Seta (A.iii.345); he had two other elephants, Bhadderaka (or Pāveyyaka) (DhA.iv.25) and Pundarīka (Ibid., ii.1).  Mention is also made (J.iii.134f ) of a pet heron which lived in the palace and conveyed messages.  Tradition says (SA.i.115; J.i.382ff ) that Pasenadi had in his possession the octagonal gem which Sakka had given to Kusa.  He valued it greatly, using it as his turban jewel, and was greatly upset when it was reported lost; it was, however, recovered with the help and advice of Ananda.  The Jātaka Commentary23 records that Pasenadi built a monastery in front of Jetavana.  It was called the Rājakārāma, and the Buddha sometimes stayed there (J.ii.15).  According to Hiouen Thsang, Pasenadi also built a monastery for Pajāpati Gotamī (Beal, Records ii.2).[/p][p]Pasenadi's chaplain, Aggidatta (q.v.) had originally been Mahākosala's chaplain.  Pasenadi therefore paid him great respect.  This inconvenienced Aggidatta, and he gave his wealth to the poor and renounced the world.  [/p][p]DhA.iii.241ff.; SNA.  (580) says that Bāvarī was Mahākosala's chaplain and Pasenadi studied under him.  When Pasenadi came to the throne, Bāvarī declared his wish to leave the world.  The king tried to prevent him but failed; he did, however, persuade Bāvarī to live in the royal park.  Bāvarī, after staying there for some time, found life in a city uncongenial.  The king thereupon detailed two of his ministers to establish a suitable hermitage for Bāvarī.[/p][p]Pasenadi's minister, Santati (q.v.), who was once allowed to reign for a week in the king's place as reward for having quelled a frontier dispute, gave his wealth to the poor and renounced the world like Aggidatta (DhA.iii.28ff).  The king was always ready to pay honour to those who had won the praise of the Buddha, as in the case of Kānā (Ibid., ii.150ff), Culla Eka Sātaka (Ibid., iii.2ff ) or Angulimālā (M.ii.100); on the other hand, he did not hesitate to show his disapproval of those who disregarded the Buddha's teaching e.g., Upananda (S.i.153f).[/p][p]Pasenadi liked to be the foremost in gifts to the Buddha and his Order.  This was why he held the Asadisadāna (q.v.) under the guidance and inspiration of Mallikā; but he was hurt when the Buddha's sermon of thanksgiving did not seem to him commensurate with the vast amount (fourteen crores) which he had spent.  The Buddha then explained to him that this lack of enthusiasm was out of consideration for the king's minister Kāla.  When the king learned that Kāla disapproved of the lavish way in which money had been spent at the almsgiving, he banished him from the court, while he allowed the minister Junha, who had furthered the almsgiving, to rule over the kingdom for seven days (DhA.iii.188ff).[/p][p]Pasenadi seems to have enjoyed discussions on topics connected with the Dhamma.  Reference has already been made to the Kosala Samyutta, which records several conversations which he held with the Buddha when visiting him in Sāvatthi; even when Pasenadi was engaged in affairs of state in other parts of the kingdom, he would visit the Buddha and engage him in conversation if he was anywhere in the neighbourhood.  Two such conversations are recorded in the Dhammacetiya Sutta (q.v.) and the Kannakatthala Sutta (q.v.).  If the Buddha was not available, he would seek a disciple.  Thus the Bāhitika Sutta (q.v.) records a discussion between Pasenadi and Ananda on the banks of the Aciravatī.  Once when Pasenadi was in Toranavatthu, midway between Sāketa and Sāvatthi, he heard that Khemā Therī was there, and went at once to visit and talk to her (S.iv.374ff).  Rhys Davids thinks (Buddhist India, p.10) that Pasenadi was evidently an official title (*38) and that the king's personal name was Agnidatta.  He bases this surmise on the fact that in the Divyāvadāna (p.  620) the king who gave Ukkatthā to Pokkarasādi is called Agnidatta, while in the Digha Nikāya (i.87) he is called Pasenadi, and that Pasenadi is used, as a designation for several kings (*39).  The evidence is, however, insufficient for any definite conclusion to be drawn.[/p][hr][p]38 The UdA.  (104) explains Pasenadi as "paccantam parasenam jinātī ti = Pasenadi." According to Tibetan sources he was so called because the whole country was illuminated at the time of his birth (Rockhill, p.  16).[/p][p]39 E.g., in Dvy.  369, for a king of Magadha and again in the Kathāsaritsāgara i.268, 298.[/p][hr][p]According to the Anāgatavamsa (J.P.T.S.  1886, p.  37), Pasenadi is a Bodhisatta.  He will be the fourth future Buddha.[/p][p]The Sutta Vibhanga (Vin.iv.298) mentions a Cittāgāra (? Art Gallery) which belonged to him.[/p]</e>

He was cast upon an island, where he wandered about naked and destitute.  The people thought he was an ascetic and built him a hermitage.  Among his followers were a Garuda king, and also a Nāga king named Pandara (or Pandaraka).  One day, at the instigation of the Garuda, the ascetic wheedled out of Pandara the secret of how the Nāgas prevented themselves from being carried off by the Garudas.  They swallowed large stones, thus making themselves very heavy.  If the Garudas seized them by their tails, they would have to disgorge the stones and could easily be carried off.  Karambiya betrayed this secret to the Garuda king who, thereupon, seized Pandara in the right way and carried him away.  Pandara begged for mercy, and the Garuda set him free, warning him never again to tell his secret.  Thereafter the Garuda and Pandara lived as friends.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Padakusalamānava Jātaka (No.  432)[/div][p]Once the queen of a Benares king, having sworn a false oath, became a horse faced yakkha.  She served Vessavana for three years and was given leave to eat people within a certain range.  One day she caught a rich and handsome brahmin, and, falling in love with him, made him her husband.  When she went out she shut him up, lest he should escape.  The Bodhisatta was born as their son, and, on learning his father's story, discovered from the yakkha how far her power extended, and then escaped with his father.  The yakkha followed, but they were outside her territory and would not be persuaded to return.  She gave her son a charm enabling him to trace the footsteps of any person, even after the lapse of twelve years.  On the strength of his charm, the lad entered the service of the king of Benares.  One day, the king and his chaplain, wishing to test him, stole some treasure, took it away by devious paths, and hid it in a tank.  The youth recovered it quite easily, tracing their footsteps even in the air.  The king wished the names of the thieves to be divulged, but this the boy would not do.  But he related to the king various stories, showing that he knew the real culprits.  The king, however, insisted on the thieves being denounced, and when the boy revealed their names, the assembled populace murdered the king and his chaplain and crowned the Bodhisatta as king.[/p][p]The story was related in reference to a seven year old boy of Sāvatthi who could recognize footsteps.  His father put him through a severe test, and then went to the Buddha, where the boy found him.  When the Buddha heard the story he revealed that of the past.  The father of the story of the past is identified with Mahā Kassapa.  J.iii.501 14.[/p]</e>

He was looked after by a woman of Sāvatthi who, hearing one day her neighbours praise the Buddha, wished to invite him to her home.  Pāthika dissuaded her from so doing; but one day, unbeknown to him, she sent her son to invite the Buddha.  The boy called at Pāthika's hermitage on the way, and the ascetic tried to dissuade him from going.  Failing to do so, he told him not to tell the Buddha where to find the house, hoping that thus they would be able to eat themselves all the food prepared for the Buddha.  The boy did as he was told, and the next day he and Pāthika hid in a room at the back of the house.  The Buddha came, and, after the meal, thanked the woman.

When the king and the chaplain went for fruit, the queen, though with child by the king, sinned with Parantapa and instigated him to kill the king while on his way to bathe in the river.  The chaplain watched this deed but said nothing, and on his return feigned to have been suddenly blinded by a snake's breath.  The queen bore a son, and when he was sixteen, the chaplain told him of what had happened and taught him the use of a sword.  Soon after, the boy killed Parantapa and returned with his mother and the chaplain to Benares, where the Bodhisatta made him his viceroy.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta,Devadatta')"]Devadatta's[/a] attempts to kill the Buddha.

On the way home he had a conflict with an ogre named Silesaloma, against whom his weapons were of no avail, as they could not penetrate the ogre's hair.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Paribbājakā[/div][p]The name given to the ascetics and recluses (not otherwise classified) of the Buddha's time.  They were not exclusively brahmin.  Their presence seems to have been recognized and respected from earlier times.  Generally speaking, their creed is formulated as a belief in perfect bliss after death for the self purged from evil, and as a conviction that this bliss can be won by brahmacariyā, by freedom from all evil in acts, words, aims, and mode of livelihood (See, e.g., M.ii.24).  [/p][p]All these four standards of conduct were bodily incorporated in the Buddha's Noble Eightfold Path, and the last of the four gave to the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aajiivakaa,Ajīvakas')"]Ajīvakas[/a] their specific name as a separate sect.  The Paribbājakas claimed to be identical with the followers of the Buddha in their tenets and teaching (E.g., M.i.64f, 84f), but the Buddha maintained that the two teachings were quite distinct.  This is clearly indicated (E.g.,Vin.i.39.) in connection with the conversion of Sāriputta and Moggallāna, who were Paribbājakas under [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sanjaya,Sañjaya')"]Sañjaya[/a].  The goal of the Paribbājakas was deathlessness (amata) which, to them, probably meant birth in the world of Brahmā.  Their conversion to the Buddha's Doctrine followed the recognition that Gotama dealt, not with effects but with causes, and that he went to the root of the matter by teaching how casual states of consciousness arose and how they could be banished for ever.  (Chalmers: Further Dialogues i.  Introd.  xxi.  For discussions on the views of the Paribbājakas as compared with those of the Buddha, see also A.iv.35ff., 378; i.215).[/p][p]The Paribbājakas were not ascetics except in so far as they were celibates; some of them were women.  They were teachers or sophists who spent eight or nine months of every year wandering from place to place for the purpose of engaging in friendly, conversational discussions on matters of ethics and philosophy, nature lore and mysticism.  They differed very much in intelligence, earnestness, and even in honesty.  Some of the views discussed in the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/brahmajala_s,Brahmajāla Sutta')"]Brahmajāla Sutta[/a], for instance, and described as those of "Eel wrigglers" and "Hair splitters", were undoubtedly truly thus described.

He was the son of the eldest of the three brothers, Mānābharana, Kittisirimegha and Sirivallabha, who ruled over Dakkhinadesa and Rohana.  He was born at Punkhagāma in the Dakkhinadesa, where Mānābharana was ruler.  His birth was accompanied by various miracles.  Vikkamabāhu II., the then reigning king at Pulatthipura, hearing of this, wished to bring the boy up at his own court and make him his heir in place of his own son.  But Mānābharana refused to consent to this, and soon after died.

Meanwhile Vikkamabāhu dies and is succeeded by his son Gajabāhu, who maintains his position in spite of the attacks of Kittisirimegha and Sirivallabha.  Parakkama, finding no scope for his talents in Rohana, seeks his uncle Kittisirimegha, who receives him joyfully and takes him to live in his capital at Sankhatthalī.

Parakkama then goes to Rājarattha, where messengers with gifts from Gajabāhu meet him, the latter following to greet him in person and bring him to the capital.  Parakkama lives at the court in Pulatthipura, but spends his time in spying out the country and intriguing with his host's subjects.  In order to lull the suspicions of Gajabāhu, he gives him his sister Bhaddavatī in marriage, keeping her dowry in his own hands.  Later, feeling his position insecure, he returns to Dakkhinadesa, meeting on the way with all kinds of adventures which put his courage to the test.  Kittisirimegha, delighted to hear of his return, sends messengers to Saraggāma to meet him.  But Parakkama hesitates to enter the capital until persuaded by his mother to do so.  Shortly after, Kittisirimegha dies and Parakkama succeeds to the throne.  He consolidates his position by various captures, including that of Gajabāhu, which follows on the storming of Pulatthipura.  But Mānābharana comes to the rescue, defeats Parakkama's army, and sets Gajabāhu free; but the latter, finding him unbearable, appeals to Parakkama for help.  War ensues, and Gajabāhu, again at liberty, flees, while his officers fight with Parakkama.  Utimately he abdicates in favour of the latter, and dies at Gangātata.  His ministers, however, send for Mānābharana, while Parakkama hastens to Pulatthipura, where he is crowned.  A campaign of varying fortunes ensues ending in the defeat of Mānābharana, who flees to his own country, where he dies.  Parakkama is then crowned a second time.  Parakkama is now sole monarch, but his rule is not universally acceptable.  In the fourth year of his reign, Sugalā, mother of Mānābharana, raises the standard of revolt in Rohana.  The campaign against her is a protracted one and is conducted by the general Rakkha.  In the early part of the campaign the Tooth and Bowl Relies are recovered and brought with great ceremony to Pulatthipura.  The rebels are gradually cornered and defeated.  Sugalā is captured, and the revolt collapses.  Rohana is quiet for a time, but rises again after some years.[/p][p]In the twelfth year of his reign, Parakkama goes to war with the king of Rāmañña, disputes having arisen about the elephant trade and the treatment of the Sinhalese ambassadors, the crowning offence being the seizing of a princess who was being sent from Ceylon to Kamboja.  A fleet is collected at Pallavavanka, and the soldiers are landed at the port of Kusumī, with the Nagaragiri Kitti at their head, a further attack being made by the Damilādhikarin Ādicca at Papphālama.  After five months the Rāmañña king is slain and peace again restored.[/p][p]Soon after, the Pandu king Parakkama being besieged by the Cola king Kulasekhara, appeals for help from Ceylon.  Parakkamabāhu sends an army under his general Lankāpura, but, in the meantime, the Pandu king has been slain and his capital Madhurā taken.  The Sinhalese army, however, landed on the opposite coast and carried on a war against the Colas, and built a fortress called Parakkamapura.  As a result of this campaign, Kulasekhara was defeated and the Pandu king's son, Vīrapandu, was crowned in the ancient capital.  The Cola prisoners were sent to Ceylon and employed in repairing the Ratanavāluka cetiya.  The village of Panduvijaya was founded by Parakkama to commemorate the victory.  The ultimate outcome of this expedition is not certain.  The Cola records claim that Lankāpura was defeated, and that his head was nailed to the gates of Madhurā together with those of his generals.  The war of the Pandyan succession did not end there.[/p][p]Parakkamabāhu now engaged in more peaceful pursuits and, after some trouble, he succeeded in reconciling the three sects of monks the Mahāvihāra, the Abhayagiri and the Jetavana and held a convocation under a thera called Mahā Kassapa.  The Vaitulya heresy now finally disappeared from Ceylon.  The king built for the use of the monks the Jetavanārāma, including a round Temple of the Tooth, in the vicinity of the royal palace, and, further to the north, he constructed the Ālāhana Parivena, the Lankātilaka vihāra and the Baddhasīmāpāsāda.  He also built the Pacchimārāma, the Uttārārāma and the Mahā Thūpa (or Damila Thūpa).[/p][p]In the three suburbs he built the Isipatana, the Kusinārārāma and the Veluvana vihāras, and, in addition, the Kapila vihāra, while he restored the shrines at Anurādhapura.[/p][p]Parakkamabāhu also enlarged and fortified Pulatthipura and adorned the city with numerous palaces and pleasure gardens.  He paid great attention to irrigation, opening the Ākāsagangā and forming or improving a system of irrigation, its centre being in the Parakkama samudda, and building numerous tanks throughout the country.[/p][p]The internal peace of the latter half of his reign was disturbed only by a rebellion near Mahātittha, this being easily quelled.[/p][p]Parakkamabāhu I.  was succeeded by his sister's son, Vijayabahu II.  According to the Nikāyasangraha, Parakkama was born after death as the god Naradeva in the Himālaya.[/p][p]Chaps.  62 79 of the Cv.  are devoted to a description of Parakkamabāhu and his reign.  The above is a very concise account of the contents of these chapters.  [/p][hr][h4]2. Parakkamabāhu[/h4][p]Son of Vijayabāhu III.  and brother of Bhuvanekabāhu.  He was born at Sirivaddhana, and, in his youth, was entrusted to the care of the monks under Sangharakkhita.  On the death of his father he ascended the throne, and reigned for thirty three years (1236 68), at Jambuddoni, as Parakkamabāhu II.  On account of his profound erudition, he received the sobriquet of Kalikāla Sāhicca sabbaññupandita ("the scholar entirely familiar with literature in the Dark Age").  The first act of his reign was the bringing of the Tooth Relic from the Billa mountain to the capital, amidst the exhibition of various miracles.  He then set about regaining Pulatthipura from the Tamils, with Māghinda and Jayabāhu at their head, and this was accomplished by 1244. In the eleventh year of his reign Ceylon was invaded by a Jāvaka (Javanese) named Candabhānu, probably a sea robber with a large force.  The attack was repulsed by Vīrabāhu, the king's nephew, but Candabhānu appeared again later.  The rest of Parakkama's life was devoted to pious works.  He invited Cola monks over to Ceylon and held a convocation, with the object of reforming the priesthood, and showed special honour to Dhammakitti, a monk of Tambarattha.  Among buildings erected by him were the Bhuvenakabāhu parivena at Billasela and the Mahāmahindabāhu parivena at Hatthiselapura.  He also restored the vihāras at Kalyāni and at Hatthavangalla.  He added to the Sirivijayasundaravihāra built by his father and inaugurated a yearly festival in Devanagara.  He made a pilgrimage to Samantakūta and erected a bridge, so that pilgrims might reach it more easily.  In all these works he was assisted by his minister Devappatirāja.  Parakkama had five sons: Vijayabāhu, Bhuvanekabāhu, Tibhuvanamalla, Parakkamabāhu and Jayabāhu.  In his old age he abdicated in favour of his son Vijayabāhu, who, because of his piety, was called Bodhisatta.  Cv., chaps.  81 9.[/p][hr][h4]3. Parakkamabāhu[/h4][p]One of the five sons of Parakkamabāhu II.  Nothing further is known of him.  Cv.lxxxvii.16.[/p][hr][h4]4. Parakkamabāhu[/h4][p]Son of Vijayabāhu IV.  and grandson of Parakkamabāhu II.  He became king about 1302 A.C., but the length of his reign is not known: He paid a visit to the Pāndyan king and recovered the Tooth and Bowl Relies which had been carried away by Ariyacakkavatti.  They were restored to Pulatthipura (Cv.xc.48ff).  It may be conjectured that Parakkama secured the Relies at the price of vassalage to the Pāndyan court.[/p][hr][h4]5. Parakkamabāhu[/h4][p]Son of Bhuvanekabāhu II.  He became king in Hatthiselapura as Parakkamabāhu IV.  in about 1325 A.C.  The length of his reign is unknown.  He paid great honour to the Tooth Relic and is said to have written, in Sinhalese, a work called the Ceremonial of the Tooth Relic (Dāthādhātucāritta).  Cv.  xc.64f.[/p][hr][h4]6. Parakkamabāhu V.  [/h4][p]King of Ceylon (Cv.xc.1; see Codrington, op.  cit., 83, 89, and Cv.  Trs.  ii.  212, n.  1).  He was, perhaps, the brother of Bhuvanekabāhu IV., and, probably, had his capital at Gangāsiripura.  The period of his reign is not definitely known, but it was somewhere between 1348 and 1360 A.C.[/p][hr][h4]7. Parakkamabāhu VI.  [/h4][p]King of Ceylon (Cv.xci.16ff.; see also Cv.  Trs., ii.215, n.  1; and Codrington, op.  cit., 90f).  He ruled at Jayavaddhanapura.  The Cūlavamsa tells us nothing of importance except that his mother was Sunettā.  We gather from other sources that his father was Vijayabāhu, but the authenticity of this information is doubtful.  The date of his accession is also uncertain.  Some place it at 1412 A.C., others at 1415 A.C.  At the beginning of his reign he lived for three years at Rājagāma, moving later to Jayavaddhanapura.  Among his religious works were the restoration of the monasteries at Gandāladoni and Lankātilaka, and the building of a temple of the Tooth in his capital, Also the founding of the Sunettā parivena in honour of his mother.  He abdicated in favour of his sister's son, Vira Parakkamabāhu, and died after a reign of fifty five years.  His reign is noted for a great output of Sinhalese literature, particularly of poetry.[/p][hr][h4]8. Parakkamabāhu VII.  [/h4][p]Also called Pandita Parakkamabāhu, son of Bhuvanekabāhu VI.  (Cv.xcii.3).  He reigned for four years (circa 1480 84 A.C.), and was slain by his uncle who became king as Vīra Parakkamabāhu.  Codrington, op.  cit., 94f.[/p][hr][h4]9. Parakkamabāhu VIII.  [/h4][p]Also called Vīra Parakkamabāhu, uncle of Parakkamabāhu VII.  (Cv.xcii.3).  He seems to have ruled from about 1484-1509 A.C.  He had constant trouble with his relations.  His successor's name is uncertain.  Codrington, op.  cit., 94f.[/p][hr][h4]10. Parakkamabāhu IX.  [/h4][p]Also called Dhamma Parakkamabāhu.  He is not mentioned in the Cūlavamsa, but probably ruled somewhere about 1509 28 A.C.  Codrington, op.  cit., 95f.[/p]</e>

The occasion of the delivery of this general injunction was the death of a monk from snake bite.  The Milinda-Pañha states (see above) that the recital of the Paritta had the Buddha's express sanction.[/p][p]The collection of Parittas is, to this day, more widely known by the laity of Burma and Ceylon than any other Pāli book, and is generally used in times of danger or of sickness, both individual and national.  Thus, Sena II., king of Ceylon, made the community of monks recite the Paritta, and by sprinkling the water charmed with Paritta he made the people free from illness, and so removed the danger of plague from the country.[/p][p]He also decreed that this practice should continue every year (Cv.li.80).[/p][p]Kassapa V.  is said to have had a Paritta ceremony performed by the three fraternities of monks to protect his people from danger and plague and bad harvest (Ibid., lii.80).[/p][p]In the recent (1935) epidemic of malaria in Ceylon, monks were taken in carts through the badly affected areas reciting the Paritta and sprinkling water.

Geiger (Cv.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Pandukābhaya[/div][p]King of Ceylon (377-307 B.C.).  He was the son of Dighagāmanī and Ummāda Cittā and was protected from death in infancy by Citta and Kālavela, who afterwards became Yakkhas.  He was brought up by a man in Dvāramandalaka, but several times his uncles, discovering his whereabouts, tried to kill him, for it had been foretold that he would slay his uncles in order to obtain possession of the kingdom.  At the age of sixteen he was apprenticed to the brahmin  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/p2_ap,Pandula')"]Pandula[/a], who taught him various arts and provided him later with the necessary money for an army.  Pandula's son,  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/canda,Canda')"]Canda[/a], was given as friend and counsellor to Pandukābhaya.  Pandukābhaya married, by force, a maiden named  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suvannapaalii,Suvannapālī')"]Suvannapālī[/a], and declared war upon his uncles, all of whom, except the eldest, Abhaya, had determined to slay him.  With the help of the Yakkhinī Cetiyā, who dwelt in Dhūmarakkhapabbata, Pandukābhaya made all preparations for a final campaign against his uncles.  For four years he lived in Dhūmarakkha, and then for seven in Aritthapabbata.  Following the counsel of Cetiyā, he enticed his uncles into a trap, and slew them and their followers at Lābugāmaka.  He then proceeded to Anurādhagāma, where he set up his capital, which, thenceforward, came to be called Anurādhapura.  His uncle, Abhaya, was made Nagaraguttika, and to him was given over the government of the city by night.[/p][p]After establishing peace in the land, Pandukābhaya proceeded to lay out his capital as a city, and among the buildings which he erected were hermitages for the Niganthas Jotiya, Giri and Kumbhanda, and dwellings for the Ājīvakas, the brahmins, etc.  He also marked out the boundaries of the villages throughout the island.  He ruled for seventy years, and died at the age of 107. He was succeeded by his son Mutasīva.  Mhv.ix.28; x.1ff.; xi.1; Dpv.v.69, 81; x.9; xi.1 12.[/p]</e>

At the moments of his birth and his Enlightenment, a shower of lotuses fell in the ten thousand worlds, hence his name.  He lived as a householder for ten thousand years in three palaces: Naravāhana, Yassa (or Yasavatī) and Vasavatti.  His wife was Vasudattā, by whom he had a son, Uttara (according to SNA.i.341, his son was Uparevata).  He left home in his palace (Vasavatti), and practised austerities only for seven days.  A maiden of Ujjeni, called Rucinandā, gave him milk rice, and the Ājīvaka Sumitta gave him grass for his seat.  His bodhi tree was a salala, under which he spent a week, and when he touched the ground with his foot, huge lotus flowers sprang out of the earth, covering his body completely with their pollen.  (The Samyuttabhānakas give this as the reason for his name.) His first sermon was preached to his cousins Devala and Sujāta, who later became his chief disciples.  The spot where the sermon was preached was Mithiluyyāna.  Sumana was Padumuttara's personal attendant, Amitā and Asamā his chief women disciples, Vitinna and Tissa his chief patrons among men, and Hatthā and Vicittā among women.  His body was fifty eight cubits high, and his aura spread for twelve yojanas.

The river  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaagiirathii,Bhagīrathi')"]Bhagīrathi[/a] formed the boundary between the divisions.  According to the [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kumbhakaara_jat_408,Kumbhakāra Jātaka')"]Kumbhakāra Jātaka[/a], the capital of Uttara Pañcāla was Kampillanagara, where a king named  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dummukha,Dummukha')"]Dummukha[/a] once reigned.

Thus, sometimes, Uttara Pañcāla was included in the Kuru kingdom (E.g., J.v.444; also Mahābhārata i.138), but at other times it formed a part of Kampillarattha (E.g., J.iii.79; v.  21, 289) Kampilla probably being the capital of Dakkhina Pañcāla.

On one occasion he came to Benares where the king, pleased with his demeanour, invited him to the palace and persuaded him to live in the royal park.  Sixteen years passed, and the king, leaving the city to quell a border rising, left his wife in the care of the ascetic.  The next day the ascetic visited the palace, and having seen the queen, fell instantly in love with her, losing all his iddhi powers.  When the king returned he found the ascetic disconsolate, and, on learning the reason, agreed to give him the queen.  But he secretly asked the queen, whose name was Mudulakkhanā, to think of some device by which she might save the ascetic's holiness.  Together the ascetic and the queen left the palace and went to a house which the king had given them and which was generally used as a jakes.  The queen made the ascetic clean the house and fetch water and do one hundred other things.  The ascetic then realized his folly and hastened back to the king, surrendering the queen.[/p][p]The story was related to a young man of rich family belonging to Sāvatthi, who became a monk and practiced meditation.  One day, while going for alms, he saw a beautiful woman and was seized with desire.  He thereupon gave up his practices, and was brought before the Buddha, who told him this story, at the conclusion of which he became an arahant.[/p][p]Ananda was the king and Uppalavannā the queen.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Mūgapakkha Jātaka (No.  538)[/div][p]Also called Temiya Jātaka.  Candādevī, wife of the king of Kāsi, had, to her great grief, no son.  Sakka's throne was heated by her piety, and he persuaded the Bodhisatta, then in Tāvatimsa, to be born as her son.  The Bodhisatta reluctantly agreed.  Great were the rejoicings over his birth.  He was called Temiya because on the day of his birth there was a great shower throughout the kingdom and he was born wet.  When he was one month old, he was brought to the king, and, as he lay in his lap, he heard grievous sentences passed on some robbers brought before the king.  Later, as he lay in bed, Temiya recollected his past births and remembered how he had once reigned for twenty years as king of Benares, and, as a result, had suffered in Ussada niraya for twenty thousand years.  Anguish seized him at the thought of having to be king once more, but the goddess of his parasol, who had once been his mother, consoled him by advising him to pretend to be dumb and incapable of any action.  He took this advice, and for sixteen years the king and queen, in consultation with the ministers and others, tried every conceivable means of breaking his resolve, knowing him to be normal in body.  But all their attempts failed, and at last he was put in a chariot and sent with the royal charioteer, Sunanda, to the charnel ground, where he was to be clubbed to death and buried.  At the queen's urgent request, however, Temiya was appointed to rule over Kāsi for one week before being put to death, but the enjoyment of royal power did not weaken his resolve.  The charioteer, under the influence of Sakka, took Temiya to what he considered to be the charnel-ground and there, while Sunanda was digging the grave, Temiya stole up behind him and confided to him his purpose and his resolve to lead the ascetic life.  Sunanda was so impressed by Temiya's words that he immediately wished to become an ascetic himself, but Temiya desired him to inform his parents of what had happened.  When the king and queen heard Sunanda's news, they went with all their retinue to Temiya's hermitage and there, after hearing Temiya preach, they all became ascetics.  The inhabitants of the three kingdoms adjacent to Benares followed their example, and great was the number of ascetics.  Sakka and Vissakamma provided shelter for them.  The crowds who thus flocked together were called the Mūgapakkha samāgama.  With the death of Malayamahādeva Thera (q.v.) came the end of those who participated in this great collection of ascetics.[/p][p]Temiya's parents are identified with the parents of the Buddha, Sunanda with Sāriputta and the goddess of the parasol with Uppalavannā.  The story was told in reference to the Buddha's Renunciation (J.vi.1-30; the story of Temiya is also given in Temiyacariyā in Cyp.iii.6).  It is often referred to (E.g., BuA.51) as giving an example of the Bodhisattva's great determination.  The Dhammika Sutta (q.v.) mentions Mūgapakkha in a list of teachers of old.[/p]</e>

He lived for a time at Kuthārī vihāra in Ambatthakola making preparations.  Kassapa came out of Sīhagiri to meet him, and, being defeated in battle, committed suicide.  Moggallāna thereupon became king as Moggallāna I., making Anurādhapura once more the capital.  At first he showed great cruelty to his father's enemies, earning the title of "Rakkhasa," but later he became gentle and engaged himself in good works.  He patronized the Dhammaruci and Sāgalika schools and gave them the Dalha and Dāthakondañña vihāras at Sīhagiri.  To Mahānāma, incumbent of Dīghāsana (?

Moggallāna instituted celebrations in its honour and gave them into the charge of Silākāla, who left the Order and became his sword bearer (asiggāhaka).  Migāra and Uttara were two of his generals.

Dabba was in charge of the distribution of alms at the ārāma where they stayed, and one day it was their turn to receive alms from a certain householder who had a reputation for providing good food.  When, however, the man heard from Dabba that it was the turn of the Mettiyabhummajakā to receive his hospitality, he was much displeased, and ordered his female slave to look after them.  The monks were greatly annoyed, and accused Dabba of having slandered them to the householder.  They, therefore, persuaded a nun named Mettiyā to go to the Buddha and accuse Dabba of having violated her chastity.  The charge was investigated and proved false and the nun expelled from the Order (Vin.ii.76ff.; iii.160ff).[/p][p]On another occasion, these monks persuaded a Licchavi, named  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaddha,Vaddha')"]Vaddha[/a], who was their patron and friend, to go to the Buddha and charge Dabba with having had relations with his wife.  This, too, was proved false, and other monks refused to accept alms from Vaddha until he had confessed his guilt (Vin.ii.124ff).  One day, while descending from Gijjhakūta, the Mettiyabhummajakā monks saw a heifer with a she goat and the idea occurred to them of calling the heifer Dabba and the she goat Mettiyā and then of spreading the story that they had seen Dabba mating with Mettiyā.[/p][p]Vin.iii.166ff.; see also iv.  37f.,  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhammapaala,Dhammapāla')"]Dhammapāla[/a] mentions a tradition, but contradicts it, that the persecution of Dabba by the Mettiyabhummajakā was so persistent that in the end he committed suicide to escape from it (UdA.431).

Migāra was a follower of the Niganthas, and was angry when Visākhā refused to wait on them and pay homage to them when they visited his house.  One day, while Migāra was eating and Visākhā was standing by his side fanning him, a monk stopped at their door, and Visākhā stepped aside that Migāra might see him.  But Migāra refused to notice the monk, whom, therefore, Visākhā asked to go away, saying that Migāra ate "stale food" (purānam).  This greatly annoyed Migāra, and he ordered her to be cast out of the house.  But the servants refused to carry out his orders, and he was obliged to agree to Visākhā's suggestion that the matter should be submitted for arbitration to the eight householders who had accompanied her to enquire into disputes of such a nature.  To them, therefore, Migāra recited a list of all his grievances against Visākhā, but she was adjudged quite innocent and threatened to return at once to her father.  Migāra begged her to stay, and she agreed on condition that he invited the Buddha and his monks for a meal.  He did so, but the Niganthas would not allow him to wait upon the Buddha.  At the conclusion of the meal, however, out of politeness, he insisted on listening to the Buddha's sermon, if only from behind a screen.  At the conclusion of the sermon Migāra became a sotāpanna, and, realizing the error of his ways, adopted Visākhā as his mother by sucking her breast.  Henceforth Visākhā was called Migāramātā.  The next day, again, the Buddha was invited, and Migāra's wife became a sotāpanna.  From that day onwards they kept open house for the Buddha and his monks.  As a token of his gratitude, Migāra held a great festival in honour of Visākhā, to which the Buddha and his monks were invited.  She was bathed in sixteen pots of perfumed water and presented with a jeweled ornament called Ghanamatthakapasādhana (DhA.i.387ff.; AA.i.220; MA.i.471f).

He was one of the sixteen pupils sent by Bāvarī to the Buddha.  When Mogharāja had asked his question of the Buddha and had received the answer, he attained arahantship.  He then attained distinction by wearing rough cloth which had been thrown away by caravaners, tailors, and dyers, and the Buddha declared him foremost among wearers of rough clothing (See also A.i.25).  Later, through want of care and former kamma, pimples and the like broke out over his body.  Judging that his lodging was infected, he spread a couch of straw in the Magadha field and lived there even during the winter.  When the Buddha asked him how he fared in the cold, he replied that he was extremely happy (Thag.207f).[/p][p]In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Mogharāja first resolved to win the eminence which was his.  In the time of Atthadassī Buddha he was a brahmin teacher, and one day, while teaching his students, he saw the Buddha, and having worshipped him with great solemnity, he uttered six verses in his praise and offered him a gift of honey.  Later, after sojourn in the deva worlds, he became a minister of King Katthavāhana, and was sent by him, with one thousand others, to visit Kassapa Buddha.  He heard the Buddha preach, entered the order, and lived the life of a monk for twenty thousand years (ThagA.i.181ff.; SN.  vs.  1006).

They seem to be parts of the same Apadāna which have become separated.  The first set (Ap.i.87f ) gives an account of the meeting of Mogharāja with Atthadassī Buddha (see above) and includes the verses uttered by Mogharāja in praise of the Buddha.  The second set (Ap.ii.486f) contains an account of his meeting with Padumuttara Buddha and the resolves he made before him.  It further mentions that, for one thousand years, in a later birth, Mogharāja suffered in hell, and that for five hundred births he suffered from skin diseases.  This was because he had lighted a fire in the Buddha's cloister and had made the floor black.  In his last birth, too, he suffered from a kuttharoga and could not sleep at night, hence his name (mogharajjasukham yasmā Mogharājā tato aham).

They met and agreed that the dog should go to the stalls and the ram to the kitchen, in order to avoid suspicion.  The king saw this and set the question to his ministers.  Only Mahosadha knew the solution and he told it to the others.  The king was pleased and gave to each a chariot, a she mule and various other gifts.  J.vi.349ff.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Mūlapariyāya Sutta[/div][p]The first sutta of the Majjhima Nikāya.  It was preached in the Subhagavana in Ukkatthā, and is claimed as striking the keynote of the entire doctrine of the Buddha (sabbadhamma-mūlapariyāya).  In the sutta the Buddha explains various contemporary systems of philosophy and points out the differences between these and his own system.  It also deals with the theory of the soul and of Nibbāna (M.i.1-6).[/p][blockquote][p]The Commentary* states that the five hundred monks to whom the sutta was addressed found no pleasure in listening to it.  The Buddha, realizing this, preached to them the Mūlapariyāya Jātaka** (q.v.).  Their pride was thereby vanquished, and they begged the Buddha for a subject of meditation.  Later, when the Buddha was away journeying, staying at the Gotamaka cetiya in Vesāli, he preached to them the Gotamaka Sutta and they became arahants.[/p][/blockquote][p][/p][blockquote][p]* MA.ii.46ff.; see also AA.i.457 and J.ii.269, where it is stated that at the end of the Gotamaka Sutta the earth trembled.[/p][p]** But in the introduction to the Jātaka itself, it is stated that the Jātaka was related, not to them, but in reference to them, after they had become Arahants.[/p][/blockquote]</e>

[/b] The son of a very rich merchant of Benares in the days of Kassapa Buddha.  His parents were sotāpannas, but he himself was an unbeliever.  When his father died, Mittavindaka stopped all alms.  His mother bribed him one full moon day to keep the fast by promising him one thousand.  He agreed to do this, and went to the monastery where he slept all night, and then, on his return to the house, refused to eat until he was given the money.  Later, he wished to go on a trading voyage, and, when his mother tried to restrain him, he knocked her down.  In mid ocean the ship refused to move, and when lots were cast, the lot fell three times on Mittavindaka.  He was, therefore, fastened to a raft and cast adrift.  The raft was cast up on an island where lived four female spirits of the dead.  They passed seven days in bliss and then seven in woe.  He lived with them for the seven days of bliss, and when they departed to do their penance, he left them and came to several islands, one after the other, each one greater than the last in prosperity and in its number of women.  He then went on the Ussada niraya, which appeared to him as a most beautiful city.  There he saw a man supporting on his head a wheel as sharp as a razor, but to Mittavindaka it appeared as a lotus bloom.  He asked the man for it, and insisted on getting it in spite of the man's warning.  No sooner had he taken the wheel on his head than he started suffering the torments of hell.  At that time the Bodhisatta, born as a deva, was going round Ussada with his retinue.  He saw Mittavindaka, who asked him the reason for his torture, and the Bodhisatta told him that it was the result of his greed and his wickedness to his mother.  There would be no salvation for him till his sins were expiated.  J.iv.1ff.; see also Losaka and the three Mittavinda Jātakas (Nos.  82, 104, 369); cp.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Mora Jātaka (No.  159)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta was once born as a golden peacock and lived on a golden hill in Dandaka.  He used to recite one spell in honour of the sun and another in praise of the Buddhas, and thus he was protected from all harm.  Khemā, queen of Benares, saw in a dream a golden peacock preaching.  She longed for the dream to come true and told it to the king.  He made enquiries, and sent hunters to catch the golden peacock, but they failed.  Khemā died of grief, and the king, in his anger, inscribed on a golden plate that anyone eating the flesh of the golden peacock would be immortal.  His successors, seeing the inscription, sent out hunters, but they, too, failed to catch the Bodhisatta.  [/p][p]Six kings in succession failed in this quest.  The seventh engaged a hunter who, having watched the Bodhisatta, trained a peahen to cry at the snap of his finger.  The hunter laid his snare, went with the peahen and made her cry.  Instantly, the golden peacock forgot his spell and was caught in the snare.  When he was led before the king and told the reason for his capture, he agreed with the king that his golden colour was owing to good deeds done in the past as king of that very city, and that he was a peacock owing to some sin he had committed.  The eating of his flesh could not make anyone young or immortal, seeing that he himself was not immortal.  Being asked to prove his words, he had the lake near the city dredged, when the golden chariot in which he used to ride was discovered.  The king thereupon paid him great honour and led him back to Dandaka.[/p][p]The story was told to a backsliding monk who was upset by the sight of a woman magnificently attired.[/p][p]Ananda is identified with the king of Benares (J.ii.33 8; the story is alluded to at J.iv.414).

But there was none in Sāvatthi rich enough to buy it, and Visākhā herself bought it back.  With the money thus obtained she built the Migāramātupāsāda at the Buddha's suggestion.  The site for the pāsāda on the Pubbārāma cost nine crores, the buildings costing another nine.

The work was completed in nine months, and the celebration of its dedication was held on the Buddha's return.  These celebrations lasted for four months and cost a further nine crores.

The princess then taught her a stanza to be repeated to the prince: "A soft hand, a well trained elephant and a black rain cloud will give you what you want."

Another monk, seeing them, thought they were on the same seat, and when the Elder returned to the vihāra, the monk showed his displeasure in various ways.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Moggaliputta Tissa Thera[/div][p]President of the Third Council.  In his penultimate birth he was a Brahmā, called Tissa, and consented to be born in the world of men at the urgent request of the arahants who held the Second Council, in order to prevent the downfall of the Buddha's religion.  He was born in the home of the brahmin Moggali of Pātaliputta.  Siggava and Candavajji had been entrusted with the task of converting him.  From the time of Tissa's birth, therefore, for seven years, Siggava went daily to the house of Moggali, but not even one word of welcome did he receive.  In the eighth year someone said to him, "Go further on." As he went out he met Moggali, and, on being asked whether he had received anything at his house, he said he had.  Moggali inquired at home and the next day charged Siggava with lying.  But hearing Siggava's explanation, he was greatly pleased and thereafter constantly offered Siggava hospitality at his house.  One day, young Tissa, who was thoroughly proficient in the Vedas, was much annoyed at finding Siggava occupying his seat and spoke to him harshly.  But Siggava started to talk to him and asked him a question from the Cittayamaka.  Tissa could not answer it, and, in order to learn the Buddha's teachings, he entered the Order under Siggava, becoming a sotāpanna soon after.  Siggava instructed him in the Vinaya and Candavajji in the Sutta and Abhidhamma Pitakas.  In due course he attained arahantship and became the acknowledged leader of the monks at Pātaliputta (Mhv.v.95ff., 131ff.; Dpv.v.55ff.; Sp.i.35 41).[/p][p]At the festival of dedication of the Asokārāma and the other vihāras built by Asoka, Moggaliputta Tissa informed Asoka, in answer to a question, that one becomes a kinsman of the Buddha's religion only by letting one's son or daughter enter the Order.  Acting on this suggestion, Asoka had both his children ordained.  Moggaliputta acted as Mahinda's upajjhāya (Mhv.v.191ff.; Sp.i.50f).  Later, because of the great gains which accrued to the monks through Asoka's patronage of the Buddha's religion, the Order became corrupt, and Moggaliputta committed the monks to the charge of Mahinda, and, for seven years, lived in solitary retreat on the Ahogangā pabbata.  From there Asoka sent for him to solve his doubts as to what measure of sin belonged to him owing to the murder of the monks by his minister.  But Moggaliputta would not come until persuaded that his services were needed to befriend the religion.  He traveled by boat to Pātaliputta, and was met at the landing place by the king who helped him out by supporting him on his arm.[/p][p]According to Sp.i.58, the king had a dream on the preceding night which the soothsayers interpreted to mean that a great ascetic (samananāga) would touch his right hand.  As the Thera touched the king's hand the attendants were about to kill him, for to do this was a crime punishable by death.  The king, however, restrained them.  The Thera took the king's hand as a sign that he accepted him as pupil.[/p][p]The king, having led him to Rativaddhana Park, begged him to perform a miracle.  This the Thera consented to do and made the earth quake in a single region.  To convince the king that the murder of the monks involved no guilt for himself, the Thera preached to him the Tittira Jātaka.  Within a week, with the aid of two yakkhas, the king had all the monks gathered together and held an assembly at the Asokārāma.  In the presence of Moggaliputta, Asoka questioned the monks on their various doctrines, and all those holding heretical views were expelled from the Order, Moggaliputta decreeing that the Vibhajjavāda alone contained the teaching of the Buddha.  Later, in association with one thousand arahants, Moggaliputta held the Third Council at Asokārāma, with himself as President, and compiled the Kathāvatthuppakarana, in refutation of false views.  This was in the seventeenth year of Asoka's reign and Moggaliputta was seventy two years old (Mhv.v.231 81; Dpv.vii.16ff., 39ff.; Sp.i.57ff).  At the conclusion of the Council in nine months, Moggaliputta made arrangements, in the month of Kattika, for monks to go to the countries adjacent to India for the propagation of the religion (For a list of these, see Mhv.xii.1ff.; Dpv.viii.1ff.; Sp.i.63ff).  Later, when the request came from Ceylon for a branch of the Bodhi tree, Asoka consulted the Elder as to how this could be carried out, and Moggaliputta told him of the five resolves made by the Buddha on his death bed (Mhv.xviii.21ff).[/p][p]The Dīpavamsa says (Dpv.  68ff., 82, 94, 96, 100f.  107f.; also vii.23ff ) that Moggaliputta Tissa's ordination was in the second year of Candagutta's reign, when Siggava was sixty four years old.  Candagutta reigned for twenty four years, and was followed by Bindusāra, who reigned for thirty seven years, and he was succeeded by Asoka.  In the sixth year of Asoka's reign, Moggaliputta was sixty-six years old, and it was then that he ordained Mahinda.  He was eighty years old at the time of his death and had been leader of the Order for sixty eight years.  He died in the twenty sixth year of Asoka's reign.[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Moriyā[/div][p]A khattiya clan of India.  Among those claiming a share of the Buddha's relics were the Moriyas of Pipphalivana.  They came rather late and had to be satisfied with a share of the ashes (D.ii.166; Bu.xxviii.4).  [/p][p]Candagutta, grandfather of Asoka, was also a Moriyan (Mhv.v.16; Dpv.vi.19).[/p][p]The Mahāvamsa Tīkā (MT.  180) contains an account of the origin of the name.  According to one theory they were so called because they rejoiced in the prosperity of their city (attānam nagarasiriyā modāpīti, ettha sañjātā ti, dakārassa rakāram katvā Moriyā ti laddhavohārā).  They lived in a delightful land.  Another theory connects the name with mora (peacock).  The city which they founded had buildings of blue stone, like the neck of the peacock, and the place always resounded with the cries of peacocks.  It is said that the Moriyans were originally Sākyan princes of Kapilavatthu, who escaped to the Himālaya regions to save themselves from the attacks of Vidūdabha, and established a city there.  Thus Asoka was a kinsman of the Buddha, for Candagutta was the son of the chief queen of the Moriyan king.  The king was killed by a neighbouring ruler and the city pillaged.  MT.183; but according to the Mudrārāksasa (Act iii.) Candragupta, was a Vrsala, a person of low birth, an illegitimate son of the last Nanda, king by a Sūdra woman, Murā.[/p][p]Asoka's mother, Dhammā, was also a Moriyan princess (MT.189).  Mention is also made of the Moriyans as a Singhalese clan (Cv.xxxviii.13; xli.69; see also Cv.Trs.i.29, n.  2).  Whether these had any connection with the Moriyans of India is not known.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Mendaka[/div][p]A very rich householder of Bhaddiyanagara in  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anga,Anga')"]Anga[/a].

DhA.i.384ff.; he had been earlier a follower of the heretics.  The heretics tried in vain to stop him from visiting the Buddha; AA.i.219f.[/p][p]It is said (Vin.i.240f.; also PSA.509; DhA.iii.372f.; Vsm.383; the accounts differ slightly ) that when he went to his granaries after his ceremonial bath, as he stood at the door, showers of grain would fall from heaven and fill the stores.  His wife,  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/candapadumaa,Candapadumā')"]Candapadumā[/a], would cook one measure of rice and one curry and serve the food, ladle in hand.  As long as there were people coming to receive the food, so long would the food cooked be un-exhausted.  Mendaka's son, Dhanañjaya, would put one thousand pieces into a purse and give money from this purse to all who needed it, and at the end of the day the purse would remain full.  His daughter in law,  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sumanadevi,Sumanadevī')"]Sumanadevī[/a], would sit by a basket containing four donas of seed paddy and distribute from this supply among the servants, enough to last for six months, but the supply of paddy would remain unexhausted.  Mendaka's slave, Punnaka, ploughed his fields with a golden plough.  With every furrow so ploughed, six other furrows would appear, three on either side, each one ammana wide.  These five people came to be known as the five very lucky ones (Pañcamahāpuññā).  When Bimbisāra heard of this, he sent his minister to Bhaddiya with a fourfold army and discovered that it was true.[/p][p]When the Buddha left Bhaddiya for Anguttarāpa, Mendaka gave orders to his servants and followed the Buddha with abundant provisions of all sorts, entertaining the Buddha and his monks with luxurious food and fresh milk.  At the end of the meal, Mendaka provided the monks with ghee and butter for their journey.  At first the monks were unwilling to accept the gifts, but the Buddha, at Mendaka's request, allowed them to do so (Viii.i.243ff).[/p][p]Mendaka was so called ("Ram") because, behind his house, in a yard eight karīsas in extent, some golden rams pranced up and down, as big as elephants, horses or bulls, hoofing the earth, smiting each other back to back.  Whenever Mendaka needed food or garments or money, he would place balls of colored thread in the mouths of the rams, and when he pulled these out, there would follow them all that he needed (PSA.504; BuA.24).[/p][p]All this was because of good deeds done in the past by Mendaka.  In the time of Vipassī Buddha, he was a householder named Avaroja.  He had an uncle of the same name, and when the latter proposed building a Gandhakuti for the Buddha, his nephew wished to help with it.  But the uncle refused his help.  He therefore built an Elephant Hall (kuñjarasālā) opposite the Gandhakuti.  In the middle of the hall was a jeweled pavilion with a seat for preaching, which contained a foot rest, all this supported by golden rams.  At the festival of dedication, he gave alms for four mouths to sixty eight hundred thousand monks and presented them with sets of three robes each, the robes given to the novices being worth one hundred thousand.  After many births, he was born in this age as setthi of Benares.[/p][p]One day, when on his way to the palace, he met the purohita, who told him that there would be a famine in three months.  Profiting by this warning, the Treasurer exerted himself to collect all possible grain and store it in every available place.  The famine came, and for many months the Treasurer and his retinue lived on the stored grain, but, in the end, the supplies were exhausted, and most of them, acting on his advice, went to the mountains in search of food.  He, his wife, his son and daughter in law and a slave remained behind.  One day, his wife cooked a nāli of rice which she had hidden away and divided it into five portions.  As the family were about to eat, a Pacceka Buddha came to the door for alms; they all gave him their portions of food and made various wishes.  As a result of these earnest wishes, Mendaka and the members of his family and his slave possessed the supernatural powers above mentioned.  During the afternoon, after the Pacceka Buddha had had the food, the Treasurer felt very hungry and asked his wife if there were any lumps of rice sticking to the bottom of the pot.  She went into the kitchen to the pot and found it full of fragrant food.  From that time their supply of food never failed.  DhA.iii.363ff.; but according to DhA.iv.203, Mendaka's name in the time of Vipassī Buddha was Aparājita.  He was a nephew of that Aparājita who, in this life, became Jotiya sethi.

The Bodhisatta, aware of this, gave them a riddle to solve: "Time consumes all, even itself, but who can consume the all consumer?" For a whole week they tried to find a solution and then owned defeat.  The Bodhisatta rebuked them, saying that they had holes in their ears but no wisdom.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Muni Sutta[/div][p]The twelfth sutta of the Sutta Nipāta (SN., pp.  35 8).[/p][p]It defines the muni as one who lives the homeless life, free of encumbrances, devoid of strife and covetousness, firm, self restrained, thoughtful, and delighting in meditation.  He has overcome all obstacles and knows all things.  He is as different from a householder as a peacock from a fast flying swan.  According to the Commentary (SNA.i.254 t ) the sutta is a composite one made up of stanzas preached on various occasions; thus, the first four verses had reference to a mother and a son who joined the Order, met frequently, and, owing to their affection for each other, fell into sin (Cp.  Mātuputtika Sutta).  The fifth was in reference to Upaka's attainment of anāgāmiphala; the sixth to Khadiravaniya Revata; the seventh was preached to Suddhodana to explain why the Buddha had renounced his luxuries.  The ninth was in reference to Ciñcā's attempt to malign the Buddha; the tenth was preached to the daughter of a Sāvatthi setthi.  Seeing a weaver's spindle and reflecting on it, she realized the crookedness of beings and was disgusted with the worldly life.  The Buddha, reading her thoughts, appeared before her in a ray of light and preached to her.  The eleventh was preached to the seven year old daughter of a weaver of Alavi, who became a sotāpanna and died soon after (See DhA.iii.170ff).  The twelfth was preached to the brahmin Pañcaggadāyaka; and the thirteenth was in reference to a treasurer of Sāvatthi who joined the Order and left it three times, on the fourth time of joining he became an arahant.  The fourteenth was in reference to the Buddha's cousin Nanda, who was being teased by the monks even after he had attained arahantship.  The last was in defence of a monk for whom a hunter conceived a friendship, providing him with alms; the monk was a forest dweller, and men blamed him saying that he told the hunter of the animals' haunts.[/p]</e>

Moliya asks a question as to who feeds on consciousness.  The Buddha rejects the question as being wrongly put and similar questions follow, which the Buddha puts in a different form and to which he provides the answers.  In another context (S.ii.50), in the same collection, Kalārakhattiya is reported as saying to Sāriputta that Moliya Phagguna had reverted to the lay life.

He asked the Buddha's permission to dwell there in meditation.  Twice the Buddha refused, but, on his third request, let him go.  There, however, Meghiya was consumed by evil thoughts and returned to the Buddha.  The Buddha preached to him on the five things which make the heart ripe for emancipation good friends, virtuous life, profitable talks, zealous exertion, insight and admonished him.  Meghiya thereupon attained arahantship.

Sankha will live in the fairy palace where once dwelt King Mahāpanadā, but later he will give the palace away and will himself become a follower of Metteyya Buddha (D.iii.75ff).[/p][p]The Anāgatavamsa (J.P.T.S.1886, pp.42, 46ff., 52; DhSA.415 gives the names of his parents) gives further particulars.  Metteyya will be born in a very eminent brahmin family and his personal name will be Ajita.  Metteyya is evidently the name of his gotta.  For eight thousand years he will live the household life in four palaces Sirivaddha, Vaddhamāna, Siddhattha and Candaka - his chief wife being Candamukhī and his son Brahmavaddhana.  Having seen the four signs while on his way to the park, he will be dissatisfied with household life and will spend one week in practicing austerities.  Then he will leave home, travelling in his palace and accompanied by a fourfold army, at the head of which will be eighty-four thousand brahmins and eighty four thousand Khattiya maidens.  Among his followers will be Isidatta and Pūrana, two brothers, Jātimitta, Vijaya, Suddhika and Suddhanā, Sangha and Sanghā, Saddhara, Sudatta, Yasavatī and Visākhā, each with eighty four thousand companions.  Together they will leave the household and arrive on the same day at the Bodhi tree.  After the Enlightenment the Buddha will preach in Nāgavana and King Sankha will, later, ordain himself under him.  Metteyya's father will be Subrahmā, chaplain to King Sankha, and his mother Brahmavatī.  His chief disciples will be Asoka and Brahmadeva among monks, and Padumā and Sumanā among nuns.  Sīha will be his personal attendant and his chief patrons Sumana, Sangha, Yasavatī and Sanghā.  His Bodhi will be the Nāga tree.  After the Buddha's death, his teachings will continue for one hundred and eighty thousand years.[/p][p]According to the Mahāvamsa (Mhv.xxxii.81f.; see Mil.159), Kākavannatissa and Vihāramahādevī, father and mother of Dutthagāmani, will be Metteyya's parents, Dutthagāmani himself will be his chief disciple and Saddhātissa his second disciple, while Prince Sāli will be his son.[/p][p]At the present time the future Buddha is living in the Tusita deva-world (Mhv.xxxii.73).  There is a tradition that Nātha is the name of the future Buddha in the deva world.[/p][p]The worship of the Bodhisatta Metteyya seems to have been popular in ancient Ceylon, and Dhātusena adorned an image of him with all the equipment of a king and ordained a guard for it within the radius of seven yojanas (Cv.xxxviii.68).[/p][p]Dappula I.  made a statue in honour of the future Buddha fifteen cubits high (Cv.xlv.62).  It is believed that Metteyya spends his time in the deva-world, preaching the Dhamma to the assembled gods, and, in emulation of his example, King Kassapa V.  used to recite the Abhidhamma in the assemblies of the monks (Cv.lii.47).  Parakkamabāhu I.  had three statues built in honour of Metteyya (Cv.lxxix.75), while Kittisirirājasīha erected one in the Rajata-vihāra and another in the cave above it (Cv.c.248,259).  It is the wish of all Buddhists that they meet Metteyya Buddha, listen to his preaching and attain to Nibbāna under him.  See, e.g., J.vi.594; MT.  687; DhSA.430.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Mūsika Jātaka (No.  373)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta was once a world famed teacher.  Among his pupils was Yava, son of the king of Benares.  He was a good student, and when he was about to leave, the Bodhisatta, foreseeing danger for him, taught him three verses (the verses are in the nature of conundrums, with double meaning).  The first two were based on incidents seen by the Bodhisatta - a horse killing the mouse that worried the sore place in his foot and throwing him into the well; and the same horse, later, trying to eat barley by putting its head through the fence; the third was made of his own accord.  Later, Yava became king, and his son, when sixteen years old, made three attempts on his life.  But they all failed because Yava repeated the stanzas taught him by the Bodhisatta.  On each occasion the uttering of the stanzas made the boy feel that he was discovered, and he confessed his guilt, whereupon he was cast into chains.[/p][p]The story was related in reference to Ajātasattu (J.iii.215 9).

Then the master suggested that they should watch and look after each other during their performances.  But Medakathalikā said that each should look after himself, which would be the better way.  [/p][p]The Commentary (SA.iii.182) adds that, in this performance, the end of the pole rests on the forehead or throat.  The man who thus holds it must watch the balance closely and not attend to the man at the end of the pole.[/p][p]The Buddha related this story at Desakā, in the Sumbha country, to the monks, and said that, in the same way, each monk should look after himself; by guarding oneself, one guards another; this is done by the cultivation of the four satipatthānas (S.v.168f).[/p][p]The name Medakathalikā, though feminine in inflection, is used for a male (SA.iii.181).[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Milakkha Tissa Thera[/div][p]He was a hunter who lived near Gāmendavāla vihāra in Rohana.  One day he caught an animal, which he killed and cooked, and then was filled with a great thirst.  Looking for water, he came to the vihāra.  There he drank ten pots of water, but his thirst was still unquenched, and while he complained bitterly about the absence of water, Cūlapindapātika Tissa Thera heard him and, looking about, saw plenty of water.  He then knew that the man's evil kamma was asserting itself.  The Elder poured water on to the man's hands, but it all dried up.  The man, realizing his wickedness, was greatly alarmed, and went and set all the captive animals free and destroyed his traps.  He then returned to the monastery and asked to be ordained.  His request was granted, and the Elder gave him a formula for meditation.  One day, while learning the Devadūta Sutta, Tissa wished to know how fierce were the fires of hell, and his teacher showed him how one spark of the fire could reduce to ashes a whole heap of wood.  This induced Tissa to put forth even greater effort, and he spent all his time in meditation living sometimes in Cittalapabbata vihāra and sometimes in Gāmendavāla vihāra with a wet blanket round his head and his feet in water.  Then, one day, he heard a novice recite the Arunavatī Sutta and he became an anāgāmin, attaining arahantship in due course (AA.i.21f.; SA.ii.199f).[/p][p]He is quoted as an example of one who strove hard to rid himself of sloth and torpor.

Others, too, visiting  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana,Jetavana')"]Jetavana[/a], and seeing him in the Preacher's seat, mistook him for an eminent Elder, but soon discovered their mistake (E.g., DhA.ii.31).[/p][p]On one occasion (A.iii.192f.; AA.ii.628) Lāludāyī even dared to contradict  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta,Sāriputta')"]Sāriputta[/a] regarding birth among the manomayadevā ??.  Three times Sāriputta repeated his statement and three times Lāludāyī contradicted him, and, there being no monk in the assembly who supported Sāriputta, he took Lāludāyī to the Buddha, where he three times repeated the same statement, being three times contradicted.  Then the Buddha called Lāludāyī "a witless fool" and silenced him.   [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda,Ananda')"]Ananda[/a] was witness to the dispute, but took no part in it, thereby winning the Buddha's censure.[/p][p]Elsewhere (A.iv.414f.; AA.ii.810), however, we find Lāludāyī listening in all humility to a discourse by Sāriputta on  [a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/n_r/nibbaana,Nibbāna')"]Nibbāna[/a], as the happiness which is not sensed (avedayitasukha).  Though Udāyī's knowledge of the Dhamma was not profound, he did not hesitate to take part in a discussion, even with the Buddha himself, when occasion arose.

This annoyed Udāyī, for we find him confronting Ananda with the fact that though he had been in the constant society of the Buddha he had not profited by it, a remark which earned the censure of the Buddha and his assurance that Ananda would certainly reach perfection in that very life (A.i.228; AA.i.441).[/p][p] [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa,Buddhaghosa')"]Buddhaghosa[/a] (ThagA.ii.7; some of the MSS.  read nātakācariyaputta ) calls Lāludāyī Kovariyaputta.

[/p][p]According to the Commentaries, (Sp.iii.517; DhA.iii.5) this Udāyī is to be identified with Lāludāyī, and if this be correct, it was perhaps the same monk who was guilty of several Vinaya offences attributed to Udāyi - see  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udaayii,Udāyi (2)')"]Udāyi (2)[/a]- though the Vinaya Commentary does not elsewhere (E.g., Sp.iii.541, 549, 552, where he is simply called Udāyi) definitely so identify him, except once (Sp.iv.804), where he is mentioned as having made an embroidered robe for a nun, which he persuaded her to wear in the assembly of the nuns!

  <e>[div class="huge"]Latukikopama Sutta[/div][p]Preached to Udāyī (Mahā Udāyi, says the Commentary) in a wood near Āpana.  Udāyī recalls the rules made by the Buddha regarding the hours for meals, how such rules were added to, until, in the end, any meal out of hours was forbidden; and he mentions how, though at first these rules involved hardship, in the end they were very helpful in dispelling unhappy states of consciousness and in implanting happy ones.  The Buddha agrees, but adds that many people are foolish, and consider such sacrifices insignificant, growing discontented when asked to make them.  But this insignificant thing develops into a bond strong enough to hold them fast.  Some people are like quails caught in traps, unable to escape from their bonds, others like mighty elephants, bursting their bonds and going where they wish.  Thus there are four types of individuals, differing according as to whether they are attached to their bonds or detached from them.  M.i.447-56; MA.ii.656-60.[/p]</e>

In his village lived one thousand families, and on the day of his conception they all had to starve and various misfortunes gradually befell them.  By a process of exclusion, they discovered that their misfortunes were due to Losaka's family, and therefore drove them out.  As soon as Losaka could walk, his mother put a potsherd into his hand and sent him to beg.  He wandered about uncared for, picking up lumps of rice like a crow.  One day, when he was seven years old, Sāriputta saw him and, feeling pity for him, ordained him.  But he was always unlucky; wherever he went, begging for alms, he received but little and never had a real meal.  In due course he became an arahant, and when the time came for him to die Sāriputta determined that he should have a proper meal.  He went with Losaka to Sāvatthi, but no one would even notice them.  He then took Losaka back to the monastery and, having collected food himself, sent it to Losaka, but the messengers entrusted with it ate it all themselves.  It was afternoon when Sāriputta discovered this; he therefore went to the king's palace and, having obtained a bowl filled with catumadhura (honey, ghee, butter and sugar), took it to Losaka and asked him to eat out of the bowl as he (Sāriputta) held it, in case the food should disappear.  That night Losaka died, and a shrine was erected over his ashes (J.i.234f).  When the Buddha was asked why Losaka was so unlucky, he related the Losaka Jātaka (q.v.).  Losaka is identified with Mittavindaka of that story.[/p]</e>

During the ages of the three previous Buddhas, it was known, respectively, as Devakūta, Sumanakūtaka and Subhakūta.  Gotama paid three visits to Ceylon, while the other three Buddhas came only once.  During their visits they consecrated various spots by spending there a short time wrapt in meditation.[/p][p]Lankā was once inhabited by Yakkhas.  Gotama Buddha obliged them to leave the Island and seek shelter in the neighboring Giridīpa.  Lankādīpa was later colonized by Vijaya and his three hundred companions.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Latukika Jātaka (No.  357)[/div][p]A quail once laid her eggs in the feeding ground of the elephants.  When the young ones were hatched, the Bodhisatta, the leader of the elephants, passed along that way with the herd, and, at the request of the mother quail, carefully avoided the young ones.  But a rogue elephant, who came after, though warned in the same way, trod on the nest and fouled it.  The quail swore revenge, and got a crow to put out the elephant's eyes and a fly to put maggots in them, and when the elephant, in great pain, looked for water, she persuaded a frog to croak on the mountain top and thus to lead the elephant into a precipice down which he fell and was killed.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to Devadatta who was identified with the rogue elephant (J.iii.174 77).  In the accounts (see Rohinī ) of the quarrel between the Sākyans and the Koliyans, this Jātaka is said to have been one of those preached by the Buddha on that occasion, showing that even such a weak animal as a quail could sometimes cause the death of an elephant.

When the question was repeated in the Buddha's presence, Moggallāna said that he had smiled on seeing various Petas with gruesome forms flying through the air.  From the text it would appear that these visions were seen again on several occasions.

It adds further that Lakkhana's failure to see the Petas was not because he lacked the divine eye but because he was not giving attention (anāvajjento), as a clairvoyant must.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Licchavī[/div][p]A powerful tribe of India in the time of the Buddha.  They were certainly khattiyas, for on that ground they claimed a share of the Buddha's relics.  D.ii.165; according to the Mtu.i.283, etc., they belonged to the Vāsistha gotta; cp.  the Mallas (q.v.), who are called Vāsetthas.[/p][p]Their capital was Vesāli, and they formed a part of the Vajjian confederacy, being often referred to as the Vajjīs (q.v.).  Their strength lay in their great unity; if one Licchavi fell ill, all the others would visit him.  The whole tribe would join in any ceremony performed in the house of Licchavi, and they would all unite in honouring any distinguished visitors to their city (DA.ii.519).  They were beautiful to look at and wore brilliantly coloured garments, riding in brightly painted carriages (D.ii.96; A.iii.219: cp.  Mtu.i.259).  The Buddha once compared them to the gods of Tāvatimsa (D.ii.96; also DhA.iii.280).[/p][p]Though this would seem to indicate that they were very prosperous and rich, they do not appear to have lived in luxury and idleness.  They are, on the contrary, spoken of (S.ii.267f) as sleeping on straw couches, being strenuous and diligent and zealous in their service (as skilful hardy archers, says the Commentary).  They also practised seven conditions of welfare (aparihānīyadhammā), which the Buddha claimed to have taught them at the Sārandada cetiya: [/p][ul][li](1) They held frequent public meetings of their tribe which they all attended; [/li][li](2) they met together to make their decisions and carried out their undertakings in concord; [/li][li](3) they upheld tradition and honoured their pledges; [/li][li](4) they respected and supported their elders; [/li][li](5) no women or girls were allowed to be taken by force or abduction; [/li][li](6) they maintained and paid due respect to their places of worship; [/li][li](7) they supported and fully protected the holy men (arahants) among them (D.ii.73f.; A.iv.15f).[/li][/ul][p]The young men among the Licchavis were evidently fond of archery, for mention is made (A.iii.76) of large numbers of them roving about in the Mahāvana, with bows and arrows, the strings set, and surrounded by hounds.  They were a martial people and fond of "sport," but we find one of their Elders, Mahānāma complaining (A.iii.76, the Lalitavistara is even more condemnatory) of them to the Buddha: "The Licchavi youths are quick tempered, rough and greedy fellows; such presents as are sent by the members of their tribe sugar cane, jujubes, sweet cakes, sweetmeats, etc.  they loot and eat; they slap the women and girls of their tribe on the back." Violation of chastity was considered a serious offence among the Licchavis, and the assembly would even give its consent to a husband's request that his unfaithful wife should be murdered (Vin.iv.225).[/p][p]According to the Buddhist books, the Licchavis were devout followers of the Buddha and held him in the highest esteem.  Five hundred Licchavis once gave a garment each to Pingiyāni, because he recited a verse in praise of the Buddha (A.iii.239).  Even careless boys, referred to above as wandering about with hounds and bows and arrows, would lay aside their arms when they saw the Buddha seated under a tree and would surround him with clasped hands, eager to hear him (A.iii.76).  There were numerous shrines in Vesāli itself, several of which are mentioned by name: Cāpāla, Sattambaka, Bahuputta, Gotama, Sārandada and Udena.  Buddhaghosa says (E.g., UdA.322f ) that these shrines were originally Yakkha cetiyas, where various Yakkhas were worshipped, but that they were later converted into monasteries for the Buddha and his Order.  It is, however, apparent from the Buddhist books themselves (E.g., in the story of the general Sīha), that Vesāli was also a stronghold of the Jains.  The Buddha visited Vesāli at least three times, and is frequently mentioned as staying in Kūtāgārasālā (q.v.) in Mahāvana.  The first visit was in order to destroy the threefold panic of drought, sickness and non human foes.  It was probably this act which earned for the Buddha the gratitude of the Licchavis.  There the Licchavis visited him in large numbers, sometimes (E.g., A.v.133f ) disturbing the calm of the spot and obliging resident monks to seek peace in Gosingasālāvana near by.  Once, five hundred Licchavis invited the Buddha to a discussion held by them at the Sārandada-cetiya regarding the five kinds of treasures.  The Buddha went and gave his opinion (A.iii.167f).[/p][p]But not all the Licchavis were followers of the Buddha.  When Saccaka the Nigantha visited the Buddha at Mahāvana, he was accompanied by five hundred Licchavis, who did not all salute the Buddha as their teacher, but showed him only such respect as was due to an honoured stranger (M.i.229; MA.i.454 gives their reasons).  Several eminent Licchavis are specially mentioned by name as having visited and consulted the Buddha; among whom are Mahānāma, Sīha, Bhaddiya, Sālha, Abhaya, Panditakumāra, Nandaka, Mahāli and Ugga.  Several Licchavis, both men and women, joined the Order - e.g., the famous courtesan Ambapālī, Jentī, Sīhā and Vāsitthī, and, among monks, Añjanavaniya, Vajjiputta and Sambhūta.  [/p][p]The Licchavis were greatly admired for their system of government.  It was a republic (gana, sangha), all the leading members of which were called rājā.  According to Mtu.i.271, there were 68,000 rājās in Vesāli; the Jātakas (i.504; iii.1) speak of 7707; DhA.iii.436.[/p][p]They held full and frequent assemblies at which problems affecting either the whole republic or individual members were fully discussed.  When the assembly drum was heard, all left other duties and assembled immediately in the Santhāgārasālā (DA.ii.517f).  Sometimes, as appears from the story of the conversion of Sīha, religion was also discussed at these meetings.  The rules of procedure adopted evidently resembled those followed in the upasatitpāda ordination of a monk.  See D.ii.76f., where the Buddha enjoins on the monks the observance of the same habits as practised by the Licchavis.  These are given at Vin.i.56 (VT.i.169f.).[/p][p]Besides the rājās there were also numerous uparājās, senāpatis, and bhandāgārikas (J.iii.1).  There was an elaborate judicial procedure by which any person charged with an offence was handed over, in turn, to the Vinicchayamahāmattas (inquirers), the Vohārikas (experts in law), Suttadharas (experts in tradition), the Atthakulakas (probably a judicial committee), the Senāpati, the Uparājā, and finally to the Rājā, who would inflict the proper sentence according to the pavenipotthaka (DA.ii.519).[/p][p]In their political relationships with their neighbours, the Licchavis seem to have been on friendly terms with Bimbisāra (q.v.), king of Magadha, and with Pasenadi, king of Kosala (See, e.g., M.ii.101, where Pasenadi says this).  Generally speaking, they were friendly also with the Mallas, though the story of Bandhula (q.v.) shows that a certain amount of rivalry existed between the two tribes.[/p][p]After the death of Bimbisāra, Ajātasattu, in his desire for the expansion of Magadha, resolved to destroy the Licchavis.  He was probably partly influenced by his fear of his foster brother Abhayarājakumāra (q.v.), who had in him Licchavi blood.  Buddhaghosa gives another story.  (DA.ii.516f.; AA.ii.703; was the port Pātaligāma? see UdA.408).  There was a port on the Ganges, extending over one yojana, half of which territory belonged to Ajātasattu, and the other half to the Licchavis.  Near by was a mountain, from which much fragrant material (? gandhabhanda) flowed into the river.  While Ajātasattu was making preparations to claim his portion of this material, the Licchavis would go before him and remove it all.  This happened on several occasions, and Ajātasattu vowed vengeance.  In order to discover what the Buddha thought of his chances of success, he sent to him his minister Vassakāra.  The Buddha predicted (D.ii.72ff ) that as long as the Licchavis remained united they were proof against any foe.  Ajātasattu then decided to bring about disunion among them.  He was successful in this, with the aid of Vassakāra.  (For details see Vassakāra).  When Ajātasattu arrived at the gates of Vesāli, the Licchavis, owing to their disunion, were unable to put up any opposition, and Ajātasattu captured the city without further trouble (DA.ii.524).  The degeneration may have set in earlier among the Licchavis, for we find reference to their giving up their earlier austere habits and to their fondness for soft pillows, long sleep and other luxuries.  (S.ii.268; see also DhA.iii.280, where they quarrel over a woman; cp.  Sp.i.284).  Their power and prosperity were probably also weakened by the plague and drought which had ravaged Vesāli.[/p][p]The Commentaries contain a mythical account of the origin of the Licchavis.  (MA.i.258; KhpA.  etc.; for a very comprehensive account of the Licchavis, see Law, Ksatriya Clans in Buddhist India, pp.1ff).  The queen of Benares gave birth to a lump of flesh, and, wishing to avoid disgrace, her ladies in waiting put it in a sealed casket and threw it into the Ganges.  A deva wrote the king's name on the casket, which was picked up by an ascetic, who tended the embryo until two children, a boy and a girl, emerged from it.  The ascetic fed them with milk.  Whatever entered the stomachs of the children could be seen as though the stomach were transparent, so that they appeared skinless (nicchavi); some said the skin was so thin (līnachavī) that the stomach and whatever entered it appeared as though sewn together.  From this the children came to be called Licchavi, and, as they grew, were brought up by the villagers living near the hermitage.  The other children disliked them, saying they were to be avoided (vajjitabbā) because of their quarrelsome disposition.  When they were sixteen years old the villagers obtained land for them from the king, founded a town, and married them together.  Their country came to be called Vajjī.  They had sixteen pairs of twins, and their city had to be greatly enlarged - hence its name, Visālā or Vesāli.[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Lohapāsāda[/div][p]A building at Anurādhapura, forming the uposatha hall of the Mahāvihāra.  It was originally built by Devānampiyatissa (see Mhv.xv.205), but it was then a small building erected only to round off the form of Mahā vihāra (vihāraparipunnamattasādhakam) (MT.  364).  Later, Dutthagāmani pulled it down and erected on its site a nine storey building, one hundred cubits square and high, with one hundred rooms on each storey.  The building was planned according to a sketch of the Ambalatthikapāsāda (the actual Ambalatthikā (q.v.) of the Lohapāsāda was to the east of the building, DA.ii.635) in Bīranī's palace which eight arahants obtained from the deva world.  The building was roofed with copper plates, hence its name.  The nine storeys were occupied by monks, according to their various attainments, the last four storeys being reserved for arahants.  In the centre of the hall was a seat made in the shape of Vessavana's Nārīvāhana chariot (for details see Mhv.xxvii.1ff).  The building was visible out at sea to a distance of one league (MT.  505).  Once Dutthagāmani attempted to preach in the assembly hall of the Lohapāsāda, but he was too nervous to proceed.  Realizing then how difficult was the task of preachers, he endowed largesse for them in every vihāra (Mhv.xxxii.42ff).  Dutthagāmani had always a great fondness for the Lohapāsāda, and as he lay dying he managed to have a last view of it (Mhv.xxxii.9).  Thirty crores were spent on its construction; in Saddhātissa's day it caught fire from a lamp, and he rebuilt it in seven storeys at a cost of nine millions.[/p][p]Khallātanāga built thirty two other pāsādas round the Lohapāsāda for its ornamentation (Mhv.xxxiii.6), while Bhātikābhaya carried out various repairs to the building (Mhv.xxxiv.39), and Amandagāmanī added an inner courtyard and a verandah (ājira) (Mhv.xxxv.3).  Sirināga I.  rebuilt it in five storeys (Mhv.xxxvi.25,52), Abhayanāga built a pavilion in the courtyard and Gothābhaya had the pillars renewed (Mhv.xxxvi.102).[/p][p]He evidently started to rebuild the structure, because we are told (Mhv.xxxvi.124) that, after his death, his son Jetthatissa completecd up to seven storeys the Lohapāsāda which had been left unfinished (vippakata) by his father.[/p][p]The building was worth one crore, and Jetthatissa offered to it a jewel worth sixty thousand, after which he renamed it Manipāsāda.  Afterwards Sona, a minister of his brother, the renegade king Mahānāma, acting on the advice of heretical monks led by Sanghamitta, destroyed the pāsāda and carried away its wealth to enrich Abhayagiri vihāra (Mhv.xxxvii.10f,59).[/p][p]Mahānāma's son, Sirimeghavanna, had the pāsāda restored to its original form (Mhv.xxxvii.62), and, later, Dhātusena renovated it (Mhv.xxxviii.54), as did Aggabodhi I., who distributed the three garments to thirty six thousand monks at the festival of dedication and assigned a village to provide for its protection (Mhv.xlii.20).  His successor, Aggabodhi II., deposited in the pāsāda the Buddha's right collar bone, which relic was later transferred to the Thūpārāma (Mhv.xlii.53,59).  In the reign of Aggabodhi IV., the ruler of Malaya repaired the central pinnacle (Mhv.xlvi.30), while Mānavamma provided a new roof (Mhv.xlvii.65).  Sena II.  completely restored the pāsāda and placed in it an image of the Buddha in gold mosaic.  The building was evidently not in use at the time, but he provided for its upkeep and assigned villages for its protection, and decreed that thirty two monks should be in constant residence (Mhv.li.69f).  Sena IV.  was in the habit of preaching in the Lohapāsāda periodical sermons to the monks (Mhv.liv.4) which were based on the suttas, but, after his death, the place again fell into disrepair and was destroyed by the Colas.  Parakkamabāhu I.  restored it once again (Mhv.lxxviii.102), but it was soon after pillaged again and fell into ruin, in which state it remains to this day.  There are now sixteen hundred monolithic stone columns (the same number as in the time of Parakkamabāhu I.), which evidently formed the framework of the lowest storey.[/p][p]Frequent mention is made in the books of sermons preached in the lowest storey of the Lohapāsāda, at which very large numbers were present.  Once, when Ambapāsānavāsī Cittagutta preached the Rathavinīta Sutta, there were twelve thousand monks and one thousand nuns (MT.552f).  On another occasion, Bhātikābhaya described the contents of the Relic chamber of the Mahā Thūpa to all the monks of the Mahāvihāra assembled in the Lohapāsāda (MT.555).[/p][p]Buddhaghosa says (DA.ii.581) that, up to his day, it was customary for all the monks of Ceylon, who lived to the north of the Mahāvālukanadī, to assemble in the Lohapāsāda twice a year, on the first and last days of the vassa, while those to the south of the river assembled at the Tissamahāvihāra.  When disputes arose as to the interpretation of various rules or teachings, the decision was often announced by a teacher of repute from the lowest storey of the Lohapāsāda (DA.ii.442, 514).[/p][p]The hood of the Nāga king Mucalinda was of the same size as the storehouse (bhandāgāragabbha) of the Lohapāsāda (UdA.101).  A mass of rock, as big as the seventh storey of the Lohapāsāda, if dropped from the Brahmaworld, would take four months to reach the earth.  DA.ii.678.[/p]</e>

Once when Mahā Kaccāna was living there in a forest hut, a number of Lohicca's pupils came there and began abusing the monks, calling them shavelings, menials, etc.  Kaccāna talked to them, telling them how degenerate were the brahmins, differing from brahmins of old, the present ones being backsliders, mere reciters, doing things for trifling gains.  The pupils went back to Lohicca and told him this.  Lohicca visited Kaccāna and discussed with him these statements, and, at the end of the talk, declared himself Kaccāna's follower.

When the Buddha went to Sālāvatikā Lohicca sent the barber, Bhesikā, to invite the Buddha and the monks in his name.  The Buddha accepted the invitation, and, at the end of the meal, questioned Lohicca regarding his views.  At the end of the discussion Lohicca became the Buddha's follower.  D.i.224ff.[/p]</e>

The title was a higher one than that of Jayamahālekhaka, which was conferred on Sumitta.  See Mbv., p.  164f., for a description of the ceremony of investiture.  It was, evidently, continued in later times, because one of the officers of Parakkamabāhu I.  was called Lankāmahālāna (Cv.lxix.12), which appears to be a corruption of "Lankāmahālekhakanāyaka."[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Lomasakassapa Jātaka (No.  433)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta was once born as Kassapa, son of the chaplain to the king of Benares.  He and the king's son shared a teacher and became friends.  When the prince became king, Kassapa, having no desire for power, left him and became an ascetic.  Because of the thick hair on his body, men called him Lomasakassapa.  Sakka grew frightened of Kassapa's power and, wishing to destroy it, appeared before the king at midnight and suggested to him that if he could persuade Kassapa to offer a sacrifice of slain beasts, he should be king over all India.  The king, therefore, sent his minister Sayha, to fetch Kassapa to him.  When Kassapa heard of the proposal he refused to go, but Sakka appeared again before the king and said that if the king's daughter, Candavadī, were offered as reward, Kassapa would come.  This proposal was agreed to, and Kassapa, tempted by the princess's beauty, agreed to come.  The people gathered at the place of sacrifice and tried to dissuade Kassapa from slaying the animals, but he refused to listen.  Many beasts were slain, and as he raised his sword to cut off the head of the royal elephant the latter raised a cry in which all the animals joined.  Roused by this uproar, Kassapa remembered his asceticism and was filled with remorse.  He admonished the king, and, sitting cross-legged in the air, developed transcendental power, which enabled him to fly through the air.[/p][p]The story was related to a passion tossed monk.  Sayha ifs identified with Sāriputta.  J.iii.514ff.; the story forms one of the dilemmas of the Milinda-Pañha, p.  219. There Kassapa is stated to have performed the Vājapeyya sacrifice.[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Lakuntaka Bhaddiya Thera[/div][p]He was born in a wealthy family of Sāvatthi and was given the title of Lakuntaka (Dwarf) owing to his very small stature.  He was, nevertheless, beautiful in body, says the ApA.; but see below.  [/p][p]Having heard the Buddha preach, he entered the Order and became learned and eloquent, teaching others in a sweet voice.  Once, on a festival day, a woman of the town, driving with a brahmin in a chariot, saw the Elder and laughed, showing her teeth.  The Elder, taking the teeth as his object, developed jhāna and became an anāgāmī.  Later, after being admonished by Sāriputta, he developed mindfulness regarding the body and became an arahant.  The Udāna (vii.1, 2) makes reference to the admonitions of Sāriputta and to the Buddha's joy when these had the desired effect.  The Commentary (UdA.360f.) gives details.[/p][p]In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a very rich householder of Hamsavatī, and, having beard the Buddha describe one of his monks as the sweetest voiced among them all, he wished for a similar distinction for himself under a future Buddha.  In the time of Phussa Buddha he was a cittapattakokila, named Nanda, (the Ap.loc.infra says he was the king's general) who, seeing the Buddha in the royal park, placed in his bowl a ripe mango.  In Kassapa Buddhas day he was the chief architect entrusted with the building of the thūpa over the Buddha's relics, and, when a dispute arose as to how big the thūpa should be, he decided in favour of a small one; hence his small stature in his last life.  ThagA.i.469ff.; Ap.ii.489f; the account in AA.i.110f.  is slightly different; the Kelisīla Jātaka (q.v.) gives a different reason for his shortness.[/p][p]In the assembly of monks the Buddha ranked him as foremost among sweet voiced monks (A.i.25) (mañjussarānam).  Several stories connected with Bhaddiya are recorded in the books.  Because of his shortness and his youthful appearance he was sometimes mistaken for a novice (DhA.iii.387).  Elsewhere (S.ii.279; cp.  Ud.vii.5) it is said that, because he was ugly and hunch backed, he was despised by his companions, and the Buddha had to proclaim to them his greatness and hold him up as an example of a man who, though small, was of great power.  Another account relates how novices used to pull his hair and tweak his ears and nose saying, "Uncle, you tire not of religion? You take delight in it?" But he showed no resentment and took no offence.  DhA.ii.148; the introduction to the Kelisīla Jātaka, (J.ii.142) speaks of thirty monks from the country who, seeing Bhaddiya at Jetavana, pulled him about until they were told by the Buddha who he was.[/p][p]It was in reference to Bhaddiya that the Buddha preached two famous riddle stanzas in the Dhammapada (294, 295; for the explanation of the riddle see DhA.iii.454), where he describes the arahant as one who has killed father and mother and two kings and destroyed a kingdom, but who yet goes scathe less the words having a metaphorical meaning.[/p][p]Several stanzas uttered by Bhaddiya in the Ambātakavana, as he sat there enjoying the bliss of arahantship, are included in the Theragāthā (Thag.vss.466 72).  [/p][p]In the Avadānasataka he is called Lakuñcika.  See Avs.ii.152 60.[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Lambakannā[/div][p]A gotta, mentioned in the Chronicles as being among the inhabitants of Ceylon.  The Lambakannas had, probably, certain duties to perform in connection with the consecration of a king.  This was perhaps the reason why Parakkamabāhu I.  gave them a prominent place in the ceremonies held in honour of the Tooth Relic (Cv.lxxiv.213); see also below, in the text.  [/p][p]We find that Ilanāga, when be went to take his ceremonial bath in Tissavāpi, was enraged on finding that the Lambakannā were not there.  As a punishment, he ordered them to work at the remaking of a road along the bank of the tank, leading to the Mahā Thūpa, and set candalas to supervise them.  Full of anger, the Lambakannas rose in revolt and seized the throne.  Three years later the king returned from exile, and, having defeated the Lambakannas, made them drag his chariot in triumphal procession.  When he proposed to behead them his mother intervened, and he contented himself with having their noses and toes cut off (Mhv.xxxv.18ff).[/p][p]The Lambakannas were evidently a powerful clan, and several members of the clan ruled as kings of Ceylon - e.g., Vasabha, Sanghatissa, Sanghabodhi and Gothābhaya, the last three of whom came from Mahiyangana and seized the throne from Vijayakumāra (Mhv.xxxvi.58ff).  Between the reign of Kittisirimegha and the Coliyan conquest in 1017 A.C.  i.e., between the third and the eleventh centuries out of thirty six kings who occupied the throne of Ceylon the majority belonged to either the Moriyā or the Lambakannā.  A clan of Lambakannas lived also in South India in the twelfth century.  When Lankāpura, acting under the orders of Parakkamabāhu I., crowned Vīrapandu as king of Pandu, three Lambakanna chiefs were asked to carry out "the duties of the Lambakannas" (Lambakannadhuram) (Cv.lxxvii.27f).[/p][p]The name may have had a totemistic origin, but according to some Singhalese Chronicles (E.g., the Saddharmaratnākara and the Pārakumbā-Sirita) the Lambakannas of Ceylon were a branch of the Moriyas.  They claimed descent from Sumitta - a prince of the Moriyan clan, who formed one of the escort that brought the Bodhi-tree from India - and Sumanā, a princess of the same race, who was at one time a nun, ordained under Sanghamīttā.  According to these Chronicles most of the kings of Ceylon down to the time of Parakkamabāhu VI.  were scions of this clan.[/p][p]In Ceylon, the Lambakannas had settlements in Rohana.  See, e.g., AA.i.262.[/p]</e>

He was probably (Cv.lxx.218; Cv.Trs.305, n.5) the son of the Lankādhinātha Kitti.  We first hear of him as having parried the attack of Gajabāhu's forces, at the pass of Khandigāma.  He was later sent in command of the expedition against Kulasekhara, to help the Pandu king, Parakkama of Madhurā.  He landed at the Pandu port of Taladilla and occupied Rāmissara.  From there he advanced to Kundukāla.  The prisoners whom he sent to Ceylon were used to help in the restoration of the Ratanavāluka cetiya.  At Kundukāla, Lankāpura built the fortress of Parakkamapura.  He defeated Kulasekhara and his numerous allies in several battles, and won over some of his allies, such as Ilankiyarāyara, Mālavarāyara and Colagangara, by gifts and honours, and captured, among other places, the fortress of Semponmāri.  He was assisted by Lankāpura Deva and Lankāgiri Sora, the general Gokanna, the Kesadhātus Loka and Kitti, and an officer named Jagadvijaya.  He then captured Mundikkāra and several other fortresses and occupied Rājinā.  He subdued the Cola and Pandu countries, and is said to have issued coins bearing the name of Parakkamabāhu I., while he restored the Pandu kingdom to Vīrapandu.  The village of Pandu vijaya was founded by the king to, commemorate the victory of Lankāpura.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Losaka Jātaka (No.  41)[/div][p]In the time of Kassapa Buddha there lived a monk who was maintained by a rich man of the district.  Into the monastery belonging to this rich man there came one day an arahant, and the former, liking his appearance, asked him to stay in the monastery, promising to look after him.  The arahant agreed, but the incumbent of the monastery grew jealous and told their patron that the arahant was lazy and good for nothing.  Some food sent by the patron for the arahant the incumbent threw into the embers.  The arahant, reading his thoughts, left and went elsewhere.  The monk was seized with remorse and was reborn in hell.  In five hundred successive births he was a Yakkha, with never enough to eat; during a further five hundred births he was a dog.  Then he was born, under the name of Mittavindaka, in a poor family in Kāsi.  Because of him, dire misfortune befell the family, and he was driven out.  In Benares he became a charity scholar under the Bodhisatta, who was a teacher there, but he was so quarrelsome that he was sent away.  He married a poor woman and had two children.  For a while he was a teacher, but the village in which he lived earned the king's displeasure seven times, their houses caught fire and the water dried up.  Having discovered the cause, the villagers drove out Mittavindaka and his family.  In a haunted forest the wife and children were eaten up by demons.[/p][p]In his wanderings Mittavindaka came to a coastal village, Gambhīra, where he took service in a ship.  On the seventh day of the voyage the ship suddenly stopped sailing.  Lots were cast, and seven times the lot fell on Mittavindaka, so they put him on a raft and lowered him overboard.  He was cast ashore on an island where lived four vimāna petas in palaces of crystal, and he enjoyed happiness with them for seven days.  From there he went to an island where lived eight goddesses in palaces of silver, thence to another where lived sixteen in palaces of jewels, thence to another still where lived thirty two in palaces of gold.  In each he stayed seven days.  From the last he went to an island of ogres.  There he seized an ogress wandering about in the shape of a goat, and, when she kicked him, he was hurled into the dry moat of Benares.  There goatherds were keeping watch for thieves, and when Mittavindaka seized a goat, hoping to be kicked back to his original place, he was caught.  As he was being led away, the Bodhisatta saw and recognized him and persuaded the goatherds to allow him to have him as a slave.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/losaka_th,Losaka Tissa')"]Losaka Tissa[/a], with whom Mittavindaka is identified.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Lomasakangiya Thera[/div][p]An arahant.  In the time of Kassapa Buddha he had been a monk.  After Kassapa Buddha had preached the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaddekaratta_s,Bhaddekaratta Sutta')"]Bhaddekaratta Sutta[/a], a certain monk had talked about it to Lomasakangiya, who, unable to understand it, said, "May I, in the future, be able to teach thee this sutta!" And the other answered "May I ask thee!"[/p][p]In the present age, Lomasakangiya was born in a Sākiyan family of Kapilavatthu, while the other monk became the deva  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/candana,Candana')"]Candana[/a].[/p][p]Lomasakangiya (so called because he was delicate and the soles of his feet were covered with hair; MA.ii.961 says he was so called because he had only a little down on his body, kāyassa īsakalomasākāratāya) did not go with the Sākiyan young men who joined the Order.  Noticing this, Candana appeared before him and questioned him on the Bhaddekaratta Sutta.  Lomasakangiya did not know it, and Candana reminded him of his past wish.  Lomasakangiya, therefore, went to consult the Buddha, and, later, wished to join the Order.  He was sent back to obtain his parents' consent.  His mother, fearing for his health, would not agree, but he uttered a verse (Thag.27) which convinced her.  After his ordination, he went into a forest, and, when his companions warned him against the cold, he repeated the verse, and, being devoted to meditation, soon won arahantship.  ThagA.i.84; the story given in Ap.ii.504f., both of the past and the present, differs in several details.[/p][p]According to the Lomasakangiya Bhaddekaratta Sutta (M.iii.199f.; cf.  Ap.ii.505, according to which, it was this sutta which led to his becoming an arahant), Candana visited Lomasakangiya in the Nigrodhārāma in Kapilavatthu, where he lived after his ordination, and questioned him on the Bhaddekaratta Sutta.  When Lomasakangiya again confessed his ignorance, Candana, taught him the verses, and then the former packed his bedding and went to Sāvatthi, where the Buddha, at his request, taught him the Sutta.[/p][p]In the time of Vipassī Buddha, he offered nāga flowers to the Buddha.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Satta vassāni Sutta[/div][p]Māra approaches the Buddha under the Ajapālanigrodha in Uruvelā, and engages him in conversation.  He asks the Buddha to go about among men and make friends and be happy, satisfied with having discovered the path of immortality for himself without feeling it necessary to teach others.  But the Buddha refuses his request, and Māra confesses that he has no longer any power over him; he is like a crab whose claws have been broken one by one.  The sutta adds that Māra had been awaiting an opportunity to find a flaw in the Buddha for seven years.  The Commentary adds six before the Enlightenment and one after.  He retires discomfited and sits not far away from the Buddha, brooding, scratching the earth with a stick.  S.i.122ff.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Sangīti Sutta[/div][p]The thirty third sutta of the Dīgha Nikāya (D.iii.207ff), preached at Ubbhataka, the new Mote Hall of the Mallas of Pāvā.  They had invited the Buddha to consecrate it by preaching there, and this he did until late into the night.  Then, seeing that his audience wished for more, he asked Sāriputta to continue the preaching while he himself rested.  Sāriputta therefore preached the Sangīti Sutta, at the end of which the Buddha expressed his great appreciation of Sāriputta's exposition.[/p][p]This sutta, like the Dasuttara, is arranged in a new plan- which is regularly followed in the Anguttara Nikāya of grouping the points or chief items brought forward, numerically, in arithmetical progression - in this case 1 to 10. This scheme is a kind of thematic index to the doctrines scattered through the Four Nikāyas.[/p][p]The Sarvāstivādins held this Sutta in high esteem, and included it (under the name of Sangītipariyāya) among the seven books constituting their Abhidhamma Pitaka.  The Tibetan recensions attribute the Sutta to Mahā Kotthita.  See Takākusu's article on the Sarvāstivādins (J.P.T.S.  1904 5).[/p][p]The sutta treats of the dasadhammā (or ten conditions) in much the same way as the Puggala-Paññatti deals with the dasapuggalā (ten individuals).[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Samitigutta Thera[/div][p]He belonged to a brahmin family of Sāvatthi and entered the Order after hearing the Buddha preach.  He attained to entire purity of conduct, but, because of some action in his former life, was attacked by leprosy, and his limbs gradually decayed.  He therefore lived in the infirmary.  One day Sāriputta, while visiting the sick, saw him and gave him an exercise on contemplation of feeling.  Practising this, Samitigutta developed insight and became an arahant.  Then he remembered his past action and uttered a verse (Thag.vs.81).[/p][p]In the past he was a householder and offered jasmine flowers to Vipassī Buddha.  In another birth he saw a Pacceka Buddha and insulted him, calling him a "leprous starveling" and spitting in his presence.  For this he suffered long in hell, and was reborn on earth in the time of Kassapa Buddha.  He became a Paribbājaka, and, losing his temper with a follower of the Buddha, cursed him "May you become a leper." He also soiled the bath powders placed by people at bathing places; hence his affliction in the present age (ThagA.i.175 f).[/p][p]He is evidently identical with Jātipūjaka of the Apadāna.

Sāriputta had a very quick intuition, and he became a [a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/s_t/sotaapanna,sotāpanna')"]sotāpanna[/a] immediately after hearing the first two lines of the stanza spoken by Assaji.  After his attainment of sotāpatti, Kolita (Moggallāna) wished to go with him to Veluvana to see the Buddha, but Sāriputta, always grateful to his teachers, suggested that they should first seek their teacher, Sañjaya, to give him the good news and go with him to the Buddha.  But Sañjaya refused to fall in with this plan.  Moggallāna attained arahantship on the seventh day after his ordination, but it was not till a fortnight later that Sāriputta became an arahant.  He was staying, at the time, with the Buddha, in the Sūkarakhatalena in Rājagaha, and he reached his goal as a result of hearing the Buddha preach the Vedānapariggaha Sutta to Dīghanakha.  This account is summarized from DhA.i.73 ff.; AA.i.88 ff.; ThagA.ii.93 ff.  Ap.i.15ff.; the story of their conversion is given at Vin.i.38ff.[/p][p]In the assembly of monks and nuns, Sāriputta was declared by the Buddha foremost among those who possessed wisdom (etadaggam mahāpaññānam, A.i.23).  He was considered by the Buddha as inferior only to himself in wisdom.  SA.ii.45; his greatest exhibition of wisdom followed the Buddha's descent from Tāvatimsa to the gates of Sankassa, when the Buddha asked questions of the assembled multitude, which none but Sāriputta could answer.  But some questions were outside the range of any but a Buddha (DhA.iii.228 f.; cf.  SNA.ii.570f.).  Similarly knowledge of the thoughts and inclinations of people were beyond Sāriputta; only a Buddha possesses such knowledge (DhA.iii.426; J.i.182).  Further, only a Buddha could find suitable subjects for meditation for everybody without error (SNA.i.18), and read their past births without limitation (SNA, ii.571).[/p][p]The Buddha would frequently merely suggest a topic, and Sāriputta would preach a sermon on it in detail, and thereby win the Buddha's approval.  (See, e.g., M.i.13; iii.46, 55, 249).  The Buddha is recorded as speaking high praise of him: "Wise art thou, Sāriputta, comprehensive and manifold thy wisdom, joyous and swift, sharp and fastidious.  Even as the eldest son of a Cakkavatti king turns the Wheel as his father hath turned it, so dost thou rightly turn the Wheel Supreme of the Dhamma, even as I have turned it." (S.i.191; cf.  SN.vs.556 f., where the Buddha is asked by Sela, who is his general, and the Buddha replies that it is Sāriputta who turns the Wheel of the Law; also M.iii.29).  He thus came to be called Dhammasenāpati, just as Ananda was called Dhammabhandāgārika.  The Anupada Sutta is one long eulogy of Sāriputta by the Buddha.  He is there held up as the supreme example of the perfect disciple, risen to mastery and perfection in noble virtue, noble concentration, noble perception, noble deliverance.  M.iii.25ff.  In the Mahāgosinga Sutta Sāriputta expresses his view that that monk is beat who is master of his heart and is not mastered by it.  The Buddha explains that Sāriputta was stating his own nature (M.i.215 f.).  The Buddha did not, however, hesitate to blame Sāriputta when necessary e.g., the occasion when some novices, becoming noisy, were sent away by the Buddha, whose motive Sāriputta misunderstood (M.i.459).  And again, when Sāriputta did not look after Rāhula properly, making it necessary for Rāhula to spend the whole night in the Buddha's jakes (J.i.161f.).[/p][p]In the Saccavibhanga Sutta (M.iii.248) he is compared to a mother teacher, while Moggallāna is like a child's wet nurse; Sāriputta trains in the fruits of conversion, Moggallāna trains in the highest good.  In the Pindapāta pārisuddhi Sutta (M.iii.294f) the Buddha commends Sāriputta for the aloofness of his life and instructs him in the value of reflection.  Other instances are given of the Buddha instructing and examining him on various topics e.g., on bhūtam ("what has come to be") (S.ii.47f), on the five indriyas, (S.v.220f., 225f., 233f ) and on sotāpatti.  S.v.347; we find the Buddha also instructing him on the cultivation of tranquillity (A.i.65); on the destruction of "I" and "mine" (A.i.133); the reasons for failure and success in enterprises (A.ii.81f.); the four ways of acquiring personality (attabhāva) (A.ii.159); the methods of exhortation (A.iii.198); the acquisition of joy that comes through seclusion (A.iii.207); the noble training for the layman (211f.); six things that bring spiritual progress to a monk (424f.); seven similar things (A.iv.30); the seven grounds for praising a monk (35); the things and persons a monk should revere (120f.); the eight attributes of a monk free from the cankers (223 f.); the nine persons who, although they die with an attached remainder for rebirth, are yet free from birth in hell among animals and among petas (379 f.); and the ten powers of a monk who has destroyed the cankers (A.v.174 f.).[/p][p]We also find instances of Sāriputta questioning his colleagues, or being questioned by them, on various topics.  Thus he is questioned by Mahā Kotthita on kamma (S.ii.112 f.); and on yoniso manasikāra (progressive discipline, S.iii.176 f.); on avijjā and vijjā (ibid., 172 f.); on the fetters of sense perception (S.iv.162 f.); on certain questions pronounced by the Buddha as indeterminate (ibid., 384 f.); on whether anything is left remaining after the passionless ending of the six spheres of contact (A.ii.161); and on the purpose for which monks lead the brahmacariya under the Buddha (A.iv.382).  The Mahāvedalla Sutta (M.i.292 ff.) records a long discourse preached by Sāriputta to Mahā Kotthita.  He is mentioned as questioning Mahā Kassapa on the terms ātāpī and ottāpī (S.ii.195f.), and Anuruddha on sekha (S.v.174 f., 298f.).  On another occasion, Anuruddha tells Sāriputta of his power of seeing the thousand fold world system, his unshaken energy, and his untroubled mindfulness.  Sāriputta tells him that his deva sight is mere conceit, his claims to energy conceit, and his mindfulness just worrying, and exhorts him to abandon thoughts of them all.  Anuruddha follows his advice and becomes an arahant.  A.i.281f.[/p][p]Moggallāna asks Sāriputta regarding the "undefiled" (their conversation forms the Anangana Sutta, M.i.25 ff.), and, at the conclusion of the Gulissāni Sutta, inquires whether the states of consciousness mentioned in that sutta were incumbent only on monks from the wilds or also on those from the villages (M.i.472f.).  Sāriputta questions Upavāna regarding the bojjhangā (S.v.76), and is questioned by Ananda regarding sotāpatti (S.v.346, 362) as regards the reason why some beings are set free in this very life while others are not (A.ii.167), and on the winning of perfect concentration (A.v.8, 320).  Ananda also questions Sāriputta (A.iii.201f.) on the speedy knowledge of aptness in things (kusaladhammesu khippanisanti), and, again, on how a monk may learn new doctrines and retain old ones without confusion (A.iii.361).  In both these cases Sāriputta asks Ananda to answer the questions himself, and, at the end of his discourse, praises him.  The Rathavinīta Sutta (M.i.145 ff.) records a conversation between Sāriputta and Punna Mantānīputta, for whom he had the greatest respect, after hearing the Buddha's eulogy of him.  Sāriputta had given instructions that he should be told as soon as Punna came to Sāvatthi and took the first opportunity of seeing him.  Among others who held discussions with Sāriputta are mentioned Samiddhi (A.iv.385), Yamaka (S.iii.109f.), Candikāputta (A.iv.403), and Laludāyi (A.iv.414).[/p][p]Among laymen who had discussions with Sāriputta are Atula (DhA.iii.327), Nakulapitā (S.iii.2f.) and Dhānañjāni (M.ii.186); Sīvalī (immediately after his birth; J.i.408), also the Paribbājakas, Jambukhādaka (S.iv.251f.), Sāmandaka (S.iv.261 f.; A.v.120), and Pasūra (SNA.ii.538), and the female Paribbājakas Saccā, Lolā, Avavādakā and Patācārā (J.iii.1), and Kundalakesī (DhA.ii.223f.).  He is also said to have visited the Paribbājakas in order to hold discussion with them (A.iv.378); see also S.iii.238f., where a Paribbājaka consults him on modes of eating.[/p][p]The care of the Sangha and the protection of its members' integrity was Sāriputta's especial concern by virtue of his position as the Buddha's Chief Disciple.  Thus we find him being sent with Moggallāna to bring back the monks who had seceded with Devadatta.  His admonitions to the monks sometimes made him unpopular e.g., in the case of the Assaji Punaabbasukā, the Chabbaggiyā (who singled him out for special venom) and Kokālika (See Channa, who reviled both Sāriputta and Moggallāna, DhA.ii.110 f.).  When Channa declared his intention of committing suicide, Sāriputta attempted to dissuade him, but without success (S.iv.55ff.; see also the Channovāda Sutta).  Monks sought his advice in their difficulties.  (See, e.g., S.iv.103, where a monk reports to him that a colleague has returned to the household life, and asks what he is to do about it).  He was greatly perturbed by the dissensions of the monks of Kosambī, and consulted the Buddha, at length, as to what he could do about it (Vin.i.354).  He was meticulous about rules laid down by the Buddha.  Thus a rule had been laid down that one monk could ordain only one samanera, and when a boy was sent to him for ordination from a family which had been of great service to him, Sāriputta refused the request of the parents till the Buddha had rescinded the rule (Vin.i.83).  Another rule forbade monks to eat garlic (lasuna), and when Sāriputta lay ill and knew he could be cured by garlic, even then he refused to eat them till permission was given by the Buddha for him to do so (Vin.ii.140).  The Dhammapada Commentary (Vin.ii.140f) describes how, at the monastery in which Sāriputta lived, when the other monks had gone for alms, he made the round of the entire building, sweeping the un-swept places, filling empty vessels with water, arranging furniture, etc., lest heretics, coming to the monastery, should say: "Behold the residences of Gotama's pupils." But even then he did not escape censure from his critics.  A story is told (DhA.iv.184f) of how he was once charged with greed, and the Buddha himself had to explain to the monks that Sāriputta was blameless.  While Sāriputta was severe in the case of those who failed to follow the Buddha's discipline, he did not hesitate to rejoice with his fellow monks in their successes.  Thus we find him congratulating Moggallāna on the joy he obtained from his iddhi powers, and praising his great attainments (praise which evoked equally generous counter praise), (S.ii.275 f ) and eulogising Anuruddha on his perfected discipline won through the practice of the four satipatthānas (S.v.301f).  It was the great encouragement given by Sāriputta to Samitigutta (q.v.), when the latter lay ill with leprosy in the infirmary, which helped him to become an arahant.  It was evidently the custom of Sāriputta to visit sick monks, as did the Buddha himself (ThagA.i.176).  So great was Sāriputta's desire to encourage and recognize merit in his colleagues that he once went about praising Devadatta's iddhi powers, which made it difficult for him when later he had to proclaim, at the bidding of the Sangha, Devadatta's evil nature (Vin.ii.189).[/p][p]Several instances are given (E.g., S.ii.274; v.70; A.i.63; ii.160; iii.186, 190, 196, 200, 292, 340; iv.325, 328, 365; v.94, 102, 123, 315, 356f) of Sāriputta instructing the monks and preaching to them of his own accord on various topics - apart from the preaching of the well known suttas assigned to him.  Sometimes these suttas were supplementary to the Buddha's own discourses (E.g., M.i.13, 24, 184, 469).  Among the most famous of Sāriputta's discourses are the Dasuttara and the Sangīti Suttas (q.v.).  Though Sāriputta was friendly with all the eminent monks surrounding the Buddha, there was very special affection between him and Ananda and also Moggallāna.  We are told that this was because Amanda was the Buddha's special attendant, a duty which Sāriputta would have been glad to undertake For details of this see Mahā Moggallāna, Ananda.  Ananda himself had the highest regard and affection for Sāriputta.  It is recorded in the Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.63) that once, when the Buddha asked Ananda, "Do you also, Ananda, approve of our Sāriputta?" Amanda replied, "Who, Sir, that is not childish or corrupt or stupid or of perverted mind, will not approve of him? Wise is he, his wisdom comprehensive and joyous and swift, sharp and fastidious.  Small is he in his desires and contented; loving seclusion and detachment, of rampant energy.  A preacher is he, accepting advice, a critic, a scourge of evil."[/p][p]Sāriputta was specially attached, also, to Rāhula, the Buddha's son, who was entrusted to Sāriputta for ordination.  Mention is made of a special sutta in the Majjhima Nikāya, (the Mahā Rāhulovāda Sutta; M.i.421f ) in which he urges Rāhula to practise the study of breathing.  The special regard which Sāriputta had for the Buddha and Rāhula extended also to Rāhulamātā, for we find that when she was suffering from flatulence.  Rāhula consulted Sāriputta, who obtained for her some mango juice, a known remedy for the disease.  (J.ii.392f) On another occasion (J.ii.433) he obtained from Pasenadi rice mixed with ghee and with red fish for flavouring when Rāhulamātā suffered from some stomach trouble.  Among laymen Sāriputta had special regard for Anāthapindika; when the latter lay ill he sent for Sāriputta, who visited him with Ananda and preached to him the Anāthapindikovāda Sutta.  At the end of the discourse Anāthapindika said he had never before heard such a homily.  Sāriputta said they were reserved for monks only, but Anāthapindika asked that they could be given to the laity and to young men of undimmed vision.  Anāthapindika died soon after and was reborn in Tusita.  M.iii.258 ff.; cf.  S.v.380, which probably refers to an earlier illness of Anāthapindika.  He recovered immediately after the preaching of Sāriputta's sermon, and served Sāriputta with rice from his own cooking pot.[/p][p]Sāriputta also, evidently, had great esteem for the householder Citta, for we are told (DhA.ii.74) that he once paid a special visit to Macchikāsanda to see him.[/p][p]Several incidents are related in the books showing the exemplary qualities possessed by Sāriputta e.g., the stories of Tambadāthika, Punna and his wife, the poor woman in the Kundakakucchisindhava Jātaka and Losaka Tissa (q.v.).  These show his great compassion for the poor and his eagerness to help them.  Reference has already been made to his first teacher, Sañjaya, whom he tried, but failed, to convert to the Buddha's faith.  His second teacher was Assaji.  It is said that every night on going to bed he would do obeisance to the quarter in which he knew Assaji to be and would sleep with his head in that direction.  DhA.iv.150 f.; cf.  SNA.i.328. If Assaji were in the same vihāra, Sāriputta would visit him immediately after visiting the Buddha.  It was in connection with this that the Dhamma Sutta (q.v.) was preached.[/p][p]The stories of the Sāmaneras Sukha and Pandita, and of the monk Rādhā, also show his gratitude towards any who had shown him favour (See also Vin.i.55 f).  His extreme affection for and gratitude to the Buddha are shown in the Sampasādanīya Sutta (q.v.).  That Sāriputta possessed great patience is shown by the story (DhA.iv.146f) of the brahmin who, to test his patience, struck him as he entered the city for alms.  But when he was wrongly accused and found it necessary to vindicate his good name, he did not hesitate to proclaim his innocence at great length and to declare his pre eminence in virtue.  (See, e.g., his "lion's roar" at A.iv.373ff).  Another characteristic of Sāriputta was his readiness to take instruction from others, however modest.  Thus one story relates how, in absent mindedness, he let the fold of his robe hang down.  A novice said, "Sir, the robe should be draped around you," and Sāriputta agreed, saying, "Good, you have done well to point it out to me," and going a little way, he draped the robe round him (ThagA.ii.116).  A quaint story is told (Ud.iv.4) of a Yakkha who, going through the air at night, saw Sāriputta wrapt in meditation, his head newly shaved.  The sight of the shining head was a great temptation to the Yakkha, and, in spite of his companion's warning, he dealt a blow on the Thera's head.  The blow was said to have been hard enough to shatter a mountain, but Sāriputta suffered only a slight headache afterwards.[/p][p]Mention is made of two occasions on which Sāriputta fell ill.  Once he had fever and was cured by lotus stalks which Moggallāna obtained for him from the Mandākinī Lake (Vin.i.214).  On the other occasion he had stomach trouble, which was again cured by Moggallāna giving him garlic (lasuna), to eat which the rule regarding the use of garlic had to be rescinded by the Buddha (Vin.ii.140).[/p][p]Sāriputta was fond of meal cakes (pitthakhajjaka), but finding that they tended to make him greedy he made a vow never to eat them (J.i.310).[/p][p]Sāriputta died some months before the Buddha.  It is true that the account of the Buddha's death in the Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta ignores all reference to Sāriputta, though it does introduce him (D.ii.81 ff ) shortly before as uttering his "lion's roar" (sīhanāda), his great confession of faith in the Buddha, which, in the commentarial account, he made when he took leave of the Buddha to die.  The Samyutta Nikāya (S.v.161) records that he died at Nālagāmaka (the place of his birth), and gives an eulogy of him pronounced by the Buddha after his death (S.v.163f).  [/p][p]There is no need to doubt the authenticity of this account.  It merely states that when Sāriputta was at Nālagāmaka he was afflicted with a sore disease.  His brother, Cunda Samanuddesa, was attending on him when he died.  His body was cremated, and Cunda took the relics to Sāvatthi with Sāriputta's begging bowl and outer robe.  The relics were wrapped in his water-strainer.  Cunda first broke the news to Ananda, who confessed that when he heard it his mind was confused and his body felt as though drugged.  Cf.  Thag.vs.1034; see also the eulogy of Sāriputta by Vangīsa during his lifetime (Thag.1231 3).  Hiouen Thsang saw the stūpa erected over the relics of Sāriputta in the town of Kālapināka (Beal, op.  cit., ii.177).  [/p][p]Together they sought the Buddha and told him of the event, and the Buddha pointed out to them the impermanence of all things.[/p][p]The Commentaries give more details.  The Buddha returned to Sāvatthi after his last vassa in Beluvagāma.  Sāriputta sought him there, and, realizing that his death would come in seven days, he decided to visit his mother, for she, though the mother of seven arahants, had no faith in the Sangha.  [This was because all her children joined the Order and left her desolate in spite of the forty crores of wealth which lay in the house.  It is said (DhA.iv.164f.) that when Sāriputta had gone home on a previous occasion, she abused both him and his companions roundly.  Rāhula was also in the company.] He therefore asked his brother, Cunda, to prepare for the journey to Nālagāmaka with five hundred others, and then took leave of the Buddha after performing various miracles and declaring his faith in the Buddha and uttering his "lion's roar." A large concourse followed him to the gates of Sāvatthi, and there he addressed them and bade them stay behind.  In seven days he reached Nālaka, where he wais met by his nephew, Uparevata, outside the gates.  Him he sent on to warn his mother of his arrival with a large number of people.  She, thinking that he had once more returned to the lay life, made all preparations to welcome him and his companions.  Sāriputta took up his abode in the room in which he was born (jātovaraka).  There he was afflicted with dysentery.  His mother, unaware of this and sulking because she found he was still a monk, remained in her room.  The Four Regent Gods and Sakka and Mahā Brahmā waited upon him.  She saw them, and having found out who they were, went to her son's room.  There she asked him if he were really greater than all these deities, and, when he replied that it was so, she reflected on the greatness of her son and her whole body was suffused with joy.  Sāriputta then preached to her, and she became a sotāpanna.  Feeling that he had paid his debt to his mother, he sent Cunda to fetch the monks, and, on their arrival, he sat up with Cunda's help and asked if he had offended them in any way during the forty four years of his life as a monk.  On receiving their assurance that he had been entirely blameless, he wiped his lips with his robe and lay down, and, after passing through various trances, died at break of dawn.[/p][p]His mother made all arrangements for the funeral, and Vissakamma assisted in the ceremony.  When the cremation was over, Anuruddha extinguished the flames with perfumed water, and Cunda gathered together the relics.  This account is summarized from SA.iii.172ff.; similar accounts are found at DA.ii.549f, etc.  Sāriputta's death is also referred to at J.i.391.[/p][p]Among those who came to pay honour to the pyre was the goddess Revatī (q.v.).  Sāriputta died on the full moon day of Kattika (October to November) preceding the Buddha's death, and Moggallāna died a fortnight later.  SA.iii.181; J.i.391; both Sāriputta and Moggallāna were older than the Buddha because they were born "anuppanne yeva hi Buddhe" (DhA.i.73).[/p][p]Sāriputta had many pupils, some of whom have already been mentioned.  Among others were Kosiya, Kandhadinna, Cullasārī, Vanavāsika Tissa, Sankicca (q.v.), and Sarabhū, who brought to Ceylon the Buddha's collar bone, which he deposited in the Mahiyangana-cetiya (Mhv.i.37f).  Sāriputta's brother, Upavāna, predeceased him, and Sāriputta was with him when he died of snake bite at Sappasondikapabbāra (S.iv.40f).[/p][p]Sāriputta's special proficiency was in the Abhidhamma.  It is said (DhSA.16f., DA.i.15, where it is said that at the end of the First Recital the Abhidhamma was given in charge of five hundred arahants, Sāriputta being already dead) that when preaching the Abhidhamma, to the gods of Tāvatimsa, the Buddha would visit Anotatta every day, leaving a nimitta Buddha, on Sakka's throne to continue the preaching.  After having bathed in the lake he would take his midday rest.  During this time Sāriputta would visit him and learn from the Buddha all that had been preached of the Abhidhamma during the previous day.  Having thus learnt the Abhidhamma, Sāriputta taught it to his five hundred pupils.  Their acquirement of the seven books of the Abhidhamma coincided with the conclusion of the Buddha's sermon in Tāvatimsa.  Thus the textual order of the Abhidhamma originated with Sāriputta, and the numerical series was determined by him.[/p][p]Sāriputta is identified with various characters in numerous Jātakas.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Sangārava[/div][p]A very learned brahmin of Candalakappa.  One day he saw Dhānañjānī trip up, and heard her exclaim three times, "Glory to the Buddha, the arahant, the all enlightened." He blamed her for thus extolling a shovelling monk, but when she told him of the Buddha's marvellous qualities, he felt a desire to see him.  Some time after, the Buddha went to Candalakappa and stayed in Todeyya's Mango grove.  When Dhānañjānī told Sangārava that he was there, Sangārava visited him and questioned him on his views on brahmins.  The Buddha said he had great regard for brahmins who had here and now won the goal, having discovered unaided a doctrine before unknown.  He himself was one of these.  He then proceeds to describe how he came to leave the household life and how, in due course, he won Enlightenment.[/p][p]Sangārava asks further whether there are any gods.  The Buddha answers that of that there is no doubt; the whole world is in agreement on that point.  Sangārava is pleased and accepts the Buddha as his teacher (M.ii.209ff).  Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.808) that Sangārava was the youngest of the Bhāradvājas (q.v.), brothers of Dhānañjānī's husband.[/p][p]The Samyutta (S.i.182f) mentions a Sangārava who is perhaps distinct from the above.  He lived in Sāvatthi and was a "bath ritualist," believing in purification by water, bathing morning and evening.  The Buddha, at Ananda's request, visited his house and preached to him the Doctrine, after which he became the Buddha's follower.[/p][p]The Commentary (SA.i.207) explains that Ananda and Sangārava had, as laymen, been friends, and Ananda was anxious to prevent "this wretch (varāko) who, for all our friendship has contracted wrong views, from becoming a hell filler; moreover he has a circle of friends, and hundreds may follow if he is converted."[/p][p]Another Samyutta passage (S.v.121f.; see Sangārava Sutta, 3) contains a sutta in which the brahmin Sangārava visits the Buddha and asks him why he can remember certain mantras with great case and others not at all.

The Buddha explains that a monk must avoid the five dangers, endure heat and cold and other discomforts, and must not be guilty of theft, anger, lying or arrogance.  He should be guided by wisdom and moderation (SN.  955 75).  The Commentary explains (SNA.ii.569f ) that the sutta is also called the Therapañha Sutta, and that it was preached on the occasion of the Buddha's descent from Tāvatimsa to Sankassa.  The Buddha desired that Sāriputta's wisdom should be adequately recognized, for Moggallāna's iddhi, Anuruddha's clairvoyance and Punna's eloquence were already famous, but Sāriputta's skill remained unknown.  The Buddha therefore related the Parosahassa Jātaka in order to show Sāriputta's wisdom in a past life.  At the end of the story, Sāriputta questioned the Buddha in eight stanzas, and the rest of the sutta was spoken by the Buddha in answer to these questions.[/p][hr][p][b]2. Sāriputta Sutta.[/b] The Buddha instructs Sāriputta on how to train oneself in order to get rid of notions of "I" and "mine." The sutta contains a quotation from the Udayapañha.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Sāmidatta Thera[/div][p]He belonged to a brahmin family of Sāvatthi, and used to go to the vihāra to hear the Buddha preach.  One day the Buddha preached for his special benefit, and, very much moved, he joined the Order.  But because of his immaturity of knowledge, he continued some time without application.  Later he was impressed by another sermon of the Buddha, and became devoted and intent, attaining arahantship soon afterwards (Thag.vs.90. ThagA.i.189).[/p][p]He is evidently identical with Adhichattiya (or Chattādhichattiya) of the Apadāna (Ap.i.170).  In the past he erected a parasol over the cetiya of Atthadassī Buddha.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Sāma Jātaka (No.  540)[/div][p]Once two hunters, chiefs of villages, made a pact that if their children happened to be of different sexes, they should marry each other.  One had a boy called Dukūlaka, because he was born in a wrapping of fine cloth; the other had a daughter called Pārikā, because she was born beyond the river.  When they grew up the parents married them, but, because they had both come from the Brahma world, they agreed not to consummate the marriage.  With their parents' consent they became ascetics, and lived in a hermitage provided for them by Sakka on the banks of the Migasammatā.  Sakka waited on them, and perceiving great danger in store for them, persuaded them to have a son.  The conception took place by Dukūlaka touching Pārikā's navel at the proper time.  When the son was born they called him Sāma, and, because he was of golden colour, he came to be called Suvannasāma.  He was the Bodhisatta.[/p][p]One day, after Sāma was grown up, his parents, returning from collecting roots and fruits in the forest, took shelter under a tree on an anthill.  The water which dripped from their bodies angered a snake living in the anthill, and his venomous breath blinded them both.  When it grew late Sāma went in search of them and brought them home.  From then onwards he looked after them.[/p][p]Piliyakkha, king of Benares, while out hunting one day, leaving his mother in charge of the kingdom, saw Sāma drawing water, and, lest he should escape, shot at him with his arrow.  The king took him for some supernatural being, seeing that the deer, quite fearless, drank of the water while Sāma was filling his jar.[/p][p]When Piliyakkha heard who Sāma was and of how he was the mainstay of his parents, he was filled with grief.  Sāma fell down fainting from the poisoned arrow, and the king thought him dead.  A goddess, Bahusodarī, who had been Sāma's mother seven births earlier, lived in Gandhamādana and kept constant watch over him.  This day she had gone to an assembly of the gods and had forgotten him for a while, but she suddenly became aware of the danger into which he had fallen.  She stood in the air near Piliyakkha, unseen by him, and ordered him to go and warn Sāma's parents.  He did as he was commanded, and, having revealed his identity, gradually informed them of Sāma's fate and his own part in it.  But neither Dukūlaka nor Pārikā spoke to him one word of resentment.  They merely asked to be taken to where Sāma's body lay.  Arrived there, Pārikā made a solemn Act of Truth (saccakiriyā), and the poison left Sāma's body, making him well.[/p][p]Bahusodarī did likewise in Gandhamādana, and Sāma's parents regained their sight.  Then Sāma preached to the marvelling king, telling him how even the gods took care of those who cherished their parents.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to a young man of Sāvatthi.  Having heard the Buddha preach, he obtained his parents' leave with great difficulty and joined the Order.  Five years he lived in the monastery, and, failing to attain insight, he returned to the forest and strove for twelve years more.  His parents grew old, and as there was no one to look after them, their retainers robbed them of their goods.  Their son, hearing of this from a monk who visited him in the forest, at once left his hermitage and returned to Sāvatthi.  There he tended his parents, giving them food and clothing which he acquired by begging, often starving himself that they might eat.  Other monks blamed him for supporting lay folk, and the matter was reported to the Buddha.  But the Buddha, hearing his story, praised him and preached to him the Mātuposaka Sutta (q.v.).[/p][p]Dukūlaka is identified with Kassapa, Pārikā with Bhaddā Kāpilānī, Piliyakkha with Ananda, Sakka with Anuruddha, and Bahusodarī with Uppalavannā (J.vi.68 95; the story is referred to at Mil.198f.; J.iv.90, etc.; see also Mtu.ii.212 ff).[/p][p]The  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/salikedara_jat484,Sālikedāra Jātaka')"]Sālikedāra Jātaka[/a] was preached in reference to the same monk.[/p][hr][p align="center"][/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Samiddhi [/div][hr][p][b]1. Samiddhi Thera.[/b] He belonged to a householder's family of Rājagaha.  From the time of his birth his family prospered, and he himself was happy and good, hence his name.  He was present at the meeting between the Buddha and Bimbisāra, and was so impressed thereby that he joined the Order.  Once, while he was at the Tapodārāma musing on his good fortune as a monk, Māra tried to terrify him.  Samiddhi told the Buddha of this, but the Buddha asked him to stay on where he was.  He obeyed, and soon afterwards won arahantship.  He then declared his aññā in a verse (Thag.vs.46), and Māra retired discomfited.  This episode is also given at S.i.119 f, but the place mentioned is not the Tapodārāma, but Silāvati.[/p][p]In the past he met Siddhattha Buddha, to whom he gave some flowers with stalks, which he picked with the help of his bow and arrow.  Fifty-one kappas ago he was a king named Jutindhara (ThagA.i.117f).  He is probably identical with Salalamāliya of the Apadāna (Ap.i.206).[/p][p]Once when Samiddhi was drying himself after bathing in the Tapodā, a Deva approached and questioned him on the Bhaddekaratta Sutta.  Samiddhi confessed ignorance, and the Deva asked him to learn it from the Buddha.  This he did from a brief sermon preached to him by the Buddha, which Mahā Kaccāna later enlarged into the Mahā Kaccāna-Bhaddekaratta Sutta (q.v.) (M.iii.192f).  A conversation between Potaliputta and Samiddhi, three years after the latter had joined the Order, led to the preaching of the Mahākammavibhanga Sutta (q.v.  ) (M.iii.207).  In the sutta the Buddha speaks of Samiddhi as moghapurisa, and Samiddhi is also teased by Potaliputta for pretending to expound the Dhamma after being only three years in the Order.  According to the Anguttara Commentary (AA.ii.799), Samiddhi was a pupil (saddhivihārika) of Sāriputta, and the Anguttara (A.iv.385f ) contains a record of a lesson given by Sāriputta to Samiddhi regarding sankappavitakkas.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Sakka[/div][hr][h4]1. Sakka[/h4][p]Almost always spoken of as “devānam indo," chief (or king) of the devas.  [/p][p]The Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.229; DhA.i.264) contains a list of his names: [/p][ul][li][p style="margin-top: 8"]he is called Maghavā, because as a human being, in a former birth, he was a brahmin named Magha.  (But see Magha; cf.  Sanskrit Maghavant as an epithet of Indra).  [/p][/li][li][p style="margin-top: 8"]As such he bestowed gifts from time to time, hence his name Purindada (Cf.  Indra's epithet Purandara, destroyer of cities) (generous giver in former births or giver in towns).  [/p][/li][li][p style="margin-top: 8"]Because he gives generously and thoroughly (sakkaccam) he is known as Sakka.  Sakra occurs many times in the Vedas as an adjective, qualifying gods (chiefly Indra), and is explained as meaning “able, capable." It is, however, not found as a name in pre Buddhist times.[/p][/li][li][p style="margin-top: 8"]Because he gives away dwelling places (āvasatham) he is called Vāsava (But see Vāsava).  [/p][/li][li][p style="margin-top: 8"]Because in one moment he can think of one thousand matters, he is called Sahassakkha (also Sahassanetta).  [/p][/li][li][p style="margin-top: 8"]Because he married the Asura maiden Sujā, he is called Sujampati.  For the romantic story of Sakka's marriage, see  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sujaa,Sujā')"]Sujā[/a].  Thus Sujā's father,  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vepacitti,Vepacitti')"]Vepacitti[/a], became Sakka's father in law.

[/p][/li][li][p style="margin-top: 8"]Elsewhere (E.g., D.ii.270; M.i.252) Sakka is addressed as  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosiya,Kosiya')"]Kosiya[/a].  [/p][/li][li][p style="margin-top: 8"]He is also spoken of as Yakkha.  M.i.252; cf.

His palace is  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vejayanta,Vejayanta')"]Vejayanta[/a] and his chariot bears the same name.  Though king of the Tāvatimsa devas, he is no absolute monarch.  He is imagined rather in the likeness of a chieftain of a Kosala clan.  The devas meet and deliberate in the Sudhammā sabhā and Sakka consults with them rather than issues them commands.  On such occasions, the Four Regent Devas are present in the assembly with their followers of the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/caatummahaaraajikaa,Cātummahārājika')"]Cātummahārājika[/a] world (See, e.g., D.ii.207f., 220f).  Among the Tāvatimsa devas, Sakka is more or less primus inter pares, yet lie surpasses his companions in ten things: length of life, beauty, happiness, renown, power; and in the degree of his five sense experiences: sight, hearing, smelling, taste and touch.  A.iv.242; these are also attributed to the rulers of the other deva worlds.[/p][p]In the Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.228, 229, 231; cf.  Mil.  90; for details of these see Magha) the Buddha gives seven rules of conduct, which rules Sakka carried out as a human being, thus attaining to his celestial sovereignty.  When the devas fight the Asuras they do so under the banner and orders of Sakka.  For details of Sakka's conquest of the Asuras see  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asura,Asura')"]Asura[/a].  The Asuras called him Jara Sakka (J.i.202).  Pajāpati, Vamna and Isāna are also mentioned as having been associated with him in supreme command (S.i.219).[/p][p]In the Samyutta Nikāya a whole Samyutta - one of the shortest, consisting of twenty five short suttas - is devoted to Sakka.  [/p][ul][li]In the first and second suttas Sakka praises energy (viriya); [/li][li]in the third he denounces timidity; [/li][li]in the fourth he shows forbearance to his enemy; (*16)[/li][li]in the fifth lie advocates the conquest of anger by kindness; [/li][li]in the sixth kindness to animals; [/li][li]in the seventh he denounces trickery, even towards enemies; [/li][li]and in the ninth he preaches courtesy and honour towards the wise.  [/li][li]In the eleventh are described the seven life long habits which raised him to his present eminent position;[/li][li]twelve and thirteen repeat this and explain his titles.  [/li][li]In the fourteenth Sakka explains how new gods, who outshine the old ones, do so because they have observed the Buddha's teaching.  [/li][li]In the fifteenth he describes as the most beautiful spot that where arahants dwell; [/li][li]in the sixteenth he praises gifts to the Order (*17); [/li][li]in the seventeenth he praises the Buddha, but is told by Sahampati that he has selected the wrong attributes for praise.  [/li][li]In eighteen to twenty he says that whereas brahmins and nobles on earth and the gods of the Cātummahārājika world and of Tāvatimsa worship him, he himself worships good men and arahants.  [/li][li]Numbers twenty one, twenty two, twenty four and twenty five are against anger, and twenty three is against deceit.[/li][/ul][blockquote][blockquote][p]*16 The enemy, in this case, is his father-in law, Vepacitta.  Sakka had a reputation for great forbearance.  In sutta 22 a Yakkha is said to have come and to have sat on his throne, to anger him.  But Sakka showed him great honour and the Yakkha vanished.  The Commentary adds (S.A.i.272) that it was no Yakkha, but a Rūpāvacara Brahmā, named Kodhabhakkha, who had come to test Sakka's patience.[/p][p]*17 The story connected with this sutta is that of Sakka, seeing the people of Anga and Magadha make preparations for a great sacrifice to Mahā Brahmā, feels pity for them and comes among them in the guise of Brahmā, advising them to take their offerings to the Buddha and seek his counsel (SA.i.270).[/p][/blockquote][/blockquote][p]These and other passages show that Sakka was considered by the early Buddhists as a god of high character, kindly and just, but not perfect, and not very intelligent.  His imperfections are numerous: in spite of his very great age, (*18) he is still subject to death and rebirth (A.i.144); as an example of this, it is mentioned that Sunetta had thirty five times been reborn as Sakka (A.iv.105), a statement confirmed by the Buddha (A.iv.89).  Sakka is not free from the three deadly evils - lust, ill will, Stupidity (*22); nor is he free from anxiety.  He is timid, given to panic, to fright, to running away.  (*23)[/p][blockquote][blockquote][p]*18 At J.ii.312, Sakka's life is given as lasting thirty million and sixty times one hundred thousand years.[/p][p]*22 A.i.144. The story of Rohini shows that Sakka was very susceptible to the charms of beauty.  He evidently liked other people to enjoy life and sent a heavenly dancer to amuse Mahāpanāda when nobody on earth could accomplish that feat (SNA.ii.400).  On another occasion, as Sakka was rejoicing in his triumph over the Asuras, he saw a crane on a hill top who wished to be able to eat fish without going down into the stream.  Sakka immediately sent the stream in full flood, to the hill top (J.iii.252).[/p][p]*23 He is mentioned in the Jātakas as frightened of ascetics who practised severe penances, lest they should unseat him from his throne, e.g., J.ii.394; also the stories of Visayha, Lomasakassapa, Kanha, Akitti, Mahā Kañcana and Isisinga.[/p][/blockquote][/blockquote][p][/p][p]In the Sakkapañha Sutta (q.v.), Sakka is said to have visited the Buddha at Vediyagiri in Ambasandā and to have asked him a series of questions.  He sends Pañcasikha with his vinā to play and sing to the Buddha and to obtain permission for him (Sakka) to visit him and question him.  It was Sakka who had given the Beluvapanduvīnā to Pañcasikha (SNA.ii.394).[/p][p]The Buddha says to himself that Sakka, for a long time past, has led a pure life, and gives him permission to question him on any subject.  It is stated in the course of the sutta (D.ii.270) that it was not the first time that Sakka had approached the Buddha for the same purpose.  He had gone to him at the Salaghara in Sāvatthi, but found him in meditation, with Bhuñjatī, wife of Vessavana, waiting on him.  He therefore left with a request to Bhuñjatī to greet the Buddha in his name.  He also declares (D.ii.286) that he has become a sotāpanna and has earned for himself the right to be reborn eventually in the Akanitthā world, whence he will pass entirely away.[/p][p]The Commentary says that Sakka was constantly seeing the Buddha and was the most zealous of the devas in the discharge of his duties to the sāsana.  DA.iii.697. In the sutta Sakka admits (D.ii.284) that he visited other brahmins and recluses as well.  They were pleased to see him, and boasted that they had nothing to teach him; but he had to teach them what he knew.  But this visit to the Buddha at Vediyagiri had a special object.  Sakka saw sips that his life was drawing to an end and was frightened by this knowledge.  He therefore went to the Buddha to seek his help.  It adds (DA.iii.732; cp.  DhA.iii.270) that, as Sakka sat listening to the Buddha, he died in his old life and was reborn a new and young Sakka; only Sakka himself and the Buddha was aware of what had happened.  The Commentary continues (DA.iii.740) that Sakka became an "uddham sota," treading the path of Anāgāmīs.  As such he will live in Avihā for one thousand kappas, in Atappa for two thousand, in Sudassanā for four thousand, and will end in the Akanittha world, after having enjoyed life in the Brahmaworlds for thirty one thousand kappas.[/p][p]An account of another interview which Sakka had with the Buddha is given in the Cūlatanhāsankhaya Sutta (q.v.).  There the question arises regarding the extirpation of cravings.  Sakka accepts the Buddha's answer and leaves him.  Anxious to discover whether Sakka has understood the Buddha's teaching, Moggallāna visits Sakka and questions him.  Sakka evades the questions and shows Moggallāna the glories of his Vejayanta palace.  Moggallāna then frightens him by a display of iddhi-power, and Sakka repeats to him, word for word, the Buddha's answer.  Moggallāna departs satisfied, and Sakka tells his handmaidens that Moggallāna is a "fellow of his" in the higher life, meaning, probably, that he himself is a sotāpanna and therefore a kinsman of the arahant.[/p][p]In a passage in the Samyutta (S.i.201) Sakka is represented as descending from heaven to make an enquiry about Nibbāna, and in another (S.iv.269f.), as listening, in heaven, to Moggallāna's exposition of the simplest duties of a good layman.  On another occasion, at Vessavana's suggestion, Sakka visited Uttara Thera on the Sankheyyaka Mountain and listened to a sermon by him (A.iv.163f.).  See also Sakka Sutta (2) and (3).[/p][p]The later books contain a good deal of additional information regarding Sakka.  His city extends for one thousand leagues, and its golden streets are sixty leagues long; his palace Vejayanta is one thousand leagues high; the Sudhammā hall covers five hundred leagues, his throne of yellow marble (Pandukambalasilāsana) is sixty leagues in extent, his white umbrella with its golden wreath is five leagues in circumference, and he himself is accompanied by a glorious array of twenty five million nymphs (J.v.386).  Other features of his heaven are the Pāricchattaka tree, the Nandā pokkharanī and the Cittalatāvana (DA.iii.716; See also Tāvatimsa).  His body is three gavutas in height (DhA.iii.269); his chief conveyance is the marvellous elephant Erāvana (q.v.), but he goes to war in the Velayanta ratha (q.v.).  Reference is often made to his throne, the Pandukambalasilāsana (q.v.), composed of yellow stone.  It grows hot when Sakka's life draws towards its end; or his merit is exhausted; or when some mighty being prays; or, again, through the efficacy of virtue in recluses or brahmins or other beings, full of potency.  J.iv.8; when the Buddha, however, sat on it, he was able to conceal it in his robe (DhA.iii.218).[/p][p]Sakka's devotion to the Buddha and his religion is proverbial.  When the Bodhisatta cut off his hair and threw it into the sky, Sakka took it and deposited it in the Cūlāmani cetiya (J.i.65).  He was present near the Bodhi tree, blowing his Vijayuttara sankha (q.v.), when Māra arrived to prevent the Buddha from reaching Enlightenment (J.i.72).  When the Buddha accepted Bimbisāra's invitation to dine in his palace, Sakka, in the guise of a young man, preceded the Buddha and his monks along the street to the palace, singing the Buddha's praises (Vin.i.38).  When the Buddha performed his Yamaka pātihārīya at the foot of the Gandamba, it was Sakka who built for him a pavilion, and gave orders to the gods of the Wind and the Sun to uproot the pavilions of the heretics and cause them great discomfort (DhA.iii.206, 208).  When the Buddha returned to Sankassa from Tāvatimsa, whither he went after performing the Twin Miracle, Sakka created three ladders - of gold, of silver, and of jewels respectively - for the Buddha and his retinue (DhA.iii.225).[/p][p]Sakka was present at Vesāli when the Buddha visited that city in order to rid it of its plagues.  His presence drove away the evil spirits, and the Buddha's task was thus made easier (DhA.iii.441).  When the Buddha and his monks wished to journey one hundred leagues, to visit Culla Subhaddā at Uggapura, Sakka, with the aid of Vissakamma, provided them with pavilions (kūtāgāra) in which they might travel by air (DhA.iii.470).  Once, when the ponds in Jetavana were quite dry, the Buddha wished to bathe and Sakka immediately caused rain to fall and the ponds were filled (J.i.330).  In Sakka's aspect as Vajirapāni (q.v.) he protected the Buddha from the insults of those who came to question him.  See also the story of Ciñcā mānavikā, when Sakka protected the Buddha from her charges.  Sakka also regarded it as his business to protect the Buddha's followers, as is shown by the manner in which he came to the rescue of the four seven year old novices - Sankicca, Pandita, Sopāka and Revata - when they were made to go hungry by a brahmin and his wife (DhA.iv.176f.).[/p][p]During the Buddha's last illness, Sakka ministered to him, performing the most menial tasks, such as carrying the vessel of excrement.  DhA.iv.269f.  He did the same for other holy men - e.g., Sāriputta.  Sakka also waited on the Buddha when he was in Gayāsīsa for the conversion of the Tebhātikajatilas (Vin.i.28f.); see also the story of Jambuka (DhA.ii.59).  The Udāna (iii.7) contains a story of Sakka assuming the guise of a poor weaver and Sujā that of his wife, in order to give alms to Mahā Kassapa who had just risen from a trance.  They succeeded in their ruse, to the great joy of Sakka (cp.  DhA.i.424f).  On other occasions - e.g., in the case of Mahāduggata Sakka helped poor men to gain merit by providing them with the means for giving alms to the Buddha (DhA.ii.135ff.).[/p][p]He was present at the Buddha's death, and uttered, in verse, a simple lament, very different from the studied verses ascribed to Brahmā.  (D.ii.157; on the importance of this verse, however, see Dial.ii.176, n.1).  At the distribution, by Dona, of the Buddha's relics, Sakka saw Dona hide the Buddha's right tooth in his turban.  Realizing that Dona was incapable of rendering adequate honour to the relic, Sakka took the relic and deposited it in the Cūlāmanicetiya (DA.ii.609).  And when Ajātasattu was making arrangements to deposit his share of the relics, Sakka gave orders to Vissakamma to set up a vālasanghātayanta for their protection (DA.ii.613).[/p][p]Sakka did all in his power to help followers of the Buddha in their strivings for the attainment of the goal, as in the case of Panditasāmanera, when he sent the Four Regent Gods to drive away the birds, made the Moon deity shroud the moon, and himself stood guard at the door of Pandita's cell, lest he should be disturbed.  (DhA.ii.143; cf.  the story of Sukha DhA.iii.96f.).  Often, when a monk achieved his ambition, Sakka was there to express his joy and do him honour.  See, e.g., the story of Mahāphussa (SNA.i.55f.).[/p][p]He was ready to help, not only monks and nuns, but also eminent laymen, such as Jotika for whom he built a palace of wondrous splendour, and provided it with every luxury (DhA.iv.  207f).  Sakka was always ready to come to the rescue of the good when in distress - e.g., in the case of Cakkhupāla when he became blind; Sakka led him by the hand and took him to Sāvatthi.  DhA.i.14f.  Many instances are found in the Jātaka where Sakka rescued the good in distress - e.g., Dhammaddhaja, Guttila, Kaccāni, the Kinnarī Candā, Sambulā, Kusa, Mahājanaka's mother, Candakumāra's mother, Candā, and Mahosadha.[/p][p]He loved to test the goodness of men, as in the case of the leper Suppabuddha, to see if their faith was genuine.  DhA.ii.34f.; see also the story of the courtesan in the Kurudhamma Jātaka (J.ii.380).[/p][p]The Jātaka contains several stories of his helping holy men by providing them with hermitages, etc.  - e.g., Kuddāla pandita, Hatthipāla, Ayoghara, Jotipāla (Sarabhanga), Sutasoma, Dukūlaka, Pārikā and Vessantara.  Sometimes, when he found that ascetics were not diligently practising their duties, he would frighten them - e.g., in the Vighāsa and Somadatta Jātakas.  The Anguttara Nikāya (iii.370f ) contains a story of Sakka punishing a deva called Supatittha, who lived in a banyan tree, because he failed to keep the rukkhadhamma.[/p][p]Sakka appears as the guardian of moral law in the world.  When wickedness is rampant among men, or kings become unrighteous, he appears among them to frighten them so that they may do good instead evil.  He is on the side of the good against the wicked, and often helps them to realize their goal.  Instances of this are seen in the Ambacora, Ayakūta, Udaya, Kaccāni, Kāma, Kāmanīta, Kumbha, Kelisīla, Kharaputta, Culladhanuggaha, Dhajavihetha, Bilārikosiya, Manīcora, Mahākanha, Vaka, Sarabhanga, Sarabhamiga and Sudhābhojana Jātakas.  Sakka patronised good men; some of the more eminent he invited to his heaven, sending his charioteer Matali to fetch them, and he showed them all honour - e.g., Guttila, Mandhātā, Sādhina, and Nimi; others he rewarded suitably - see, e.g., the Uraga Jātaka.[/p][p]The lesser gods consulted Sakka in their difficulties and problems e.g., in the case of the deity of Anāthapindika's fourth gateway, who incurred the displeasure of Anāthapindika by advising him to refrain from too much generosity towards the Buddha and his monks (J.i.229).  Sakka has also to deal with disputes arising among the devas themselves (DA.iii.705).  On several occasions Sakka helped the Bodhisatta in the practice of his Perfections e.g., as King Sivi, Temiya, Nimi and Vessantara, also in his birth as a hare; in this last story, the Sasa Jātaka (q.v.), Sakka paints the picture of a hare in the moon to commemorate the Bodhisatta's sacrifice.[/p][p]Sakka sometimes answers the prayers of good and barren women and gives them sons - e.g., Sumedhā, Sīlavatī, Candādevī.  Mention is also made of other boons granted by Sakka to various persons.  Thus in the Mahāsuka Jātaka he visited the parrot who clung to the dead stump of a tree through gratitude, and granted him the boon that the tree should once more become fruitful (J.iii.493).  He granted four boons to Kanha, that he might be calm, bear no malice or hatred against his neighbour, feel no greed for others' glory, and no lust towards his neighbour (J.iv.10).  To Akitti he granted several boons, the last of which was that he should have no more visits from Sakka! (J.iv.240f).  When Sivi became blind, Sakka gave him two eyes; these were not natural eyes, but the eyes of Truth, Absolute and Perfect (saccapāramitā cakkhunī).  Sakka confesses that he has not the power of restoring sight; it was the virtue of Sivi himself which had that power (J.iv.410f).  When Sīlavatī wished for a boon, Sakka, took her to heaven, where he kept her for seven days; then he granted that she should have two sons, one wise and ugly and the other a fool and handsome.  He also presented her with a piece of kusa grass, a heavenly robe, a piece of sandalwood, the flower of the Pāricchattaka tree and a Kokanda lute.  All this passed into the possession of Kusa, and, later, Sakka gave him the Verocana jewel (J.v.280f., 310).  He gave Phusatī, mother of Vessantara, ten boons (J.vi.481f) and to Vessantara himself he gave eight (J.vi.572).[/p][p]In the Sarabhanga Jātaka (J.v.392) mention is made of four daughters of Sakka - Āsā, Saddhā, Hirī and Sirī.  His wife, Sujā, accompanied him everywhere on his travels (E.g., J.iii.491), even into the world of men, because that was the boon she had asked for on her marriage to him (DhA.i.279).  Vessavana was Sakka's special friend (MA.i.476f), and when one Vessavana died, it was Sakka's duty to appoint a successor (J.i.328).  Matāli (q.v.) is Sakka's charioteer and constant companion.  Vissakamma (q.v.) is his "handy man." Sakka has twenty five million handmaids and five hundred dove-footed nymphs (kakutapādiniyo), famed for their beauty.  It was the sight of these which tempted the Buddha's step brother, Nanda, to give up thoughts of Janapadakalyānī Nandā (J.ii.93).  Sakka's special weapon is the Vajirāvudha and his special drum the Ālambara (q.v.).[/p][p]His voice is sweet, like the tintinnabulation of golden bells (SA.i.273).[/p][p]It is Sakka's special duty to protect the religion of the Buddha in Ceylon.  As the Buddha lay dying, he enjoined on Sakka the task of looking after Vijaya and his successors.  This duty Sakka, in turn, entrusted to the god Uppalavanna (Mhv.vii.1ff).  Sakka informed Mahinda of the right moment for his visit to Ceylon (Mhv.xiii.15).  When Devānampiyatissa wished for relics to place in the Thūpārāma Thūpa, Sumana sāmanera visited Sakka and obtained from him the right collar bone of the Buddha, which Sakka had placed in the Culāmani cetiya (Mhv.xvii.9ff).  Again, when Dutthagāmanī was in need of building materials for the Mahā Thūpa, it was Sakka who supplied them (Mhv.xxviii.6ff).  On the occasion of the enshrining of the relics in the Mahā Thūpa, Sakka gave orders to Vissakamma to decorate the whole of Ceylon.  He also provided the throne and casket of gold for the relics brought from the Nāgā world by Sonuttara and was himself present at the festival, blowing his conch shell.  (Mhv.xxxi.34, 75, 78)[/p][p]Other Cakkavālas have also their Sakka (aññehi Cakkavālehi Sakkā āgacchanti; J.i.203.), and in one place (J.i.204) mention is made of many thousands of Sakkas.[/p][p]It is evident from the foregoing account that, as Rhys Davids suggests (Dial.ii.297f), Sakka and Indra are independent conceptions.  None of the personal characteristics of Sakka resemble those of Indra.  Some epithets are identical but are evidently borrowed, though they are differently explained.  The conception of the popular god which appealed to a more barbarous age and to the clans fighting their way into a new country, seems to have been softened and refined in order to meet the ideals of a more cultured and peaceful civilization.  The old name no longer fitted the new god, and, as time went on, Sakka came to be regarded as an entirely separate god.[/p][hr][p][b]2. Sakka.  [/b] A Yakkha.  See Sakka Sutta (1).[/p][hr][p][b]3. Sakka.  [/b] Another form of Sākya (q.v.).  E.g., A.iv.195; v.334.[/p][hr][p][b]Sakka Samyutta.  [/b] The eleventh section of the Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.216 42).  It contains twenty five short discourses connected with Sakka (q.v.).[/p][hr][p][b]1. Sakka Sutta.[/b] A Yakkha visits the Buddha at Gijjhakūta and tells him that he should not spend his time teaching others.  The Buddha answers that he does it out of sympathy and compassion (S.i.206).[/p][p]The Commentary adds (SA.i.232) that this Sakka was a Yakkha belonging to Māra's faction.  (Mārapakkhiko).[/p][hr][p][b]2. Sakka Sutta.  [/b] Sakka, king of the devas, visits the Buddha at Gījjhakūta and asks him why only some beings are fully set free in this life.  Because of grasping, answers the Buddha.  S.iv.101.[/p][hr][p][b]3. Sakka Sutta.  [/b] A series of four conversations which Sakka and his retinue had with Moggallāna, at Jetavana, on various simple topics, such as taking refuge in the Buddha, having unwavering faith in him, etc.  S.iv.269ff.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Savittha Thera[/div][p]In the Anguttara (A.i.118f) he is represented as saying, in the course of a conversation between him, Sāriputta and Kotthita, that he preferred the person who obtains relief by faith (saddhā), to one who testifies to the truth with the body or one who has won view.  [/p][p]The Commentary (AA.i.353) explains that Savittha himself won arahantship through faith, and that therefore he praises faith.  [/p][p]The Samyutta (S.ii.115) contains two conversations of Savittha, both of which took place at the Ghositārāma in Kosambī.  The first is with Musīla and deals with the paticcasamuppāda.  Musīla, in answer to Savittha's questions, says that he has realized the truth of the paticcasamuppāda as his very own.  "Then you are an arahant," says Savittha, and Musīla remains silent.  In the other conversation, Nārada, present at the discussion, in the company of Ananda, requests that the same questions be put to him.  This Savittha does, and he tells Savittha that he has realized the truth of the Paticcasamuppāda by right insight and that, yet, he is not an arahant.  He is like a man who sees a well containing water, but who has neither rope nor vessel.  "Now, what will you say of Nārada?" asks Ananda.  "Nothing that is not lovely and good," answers Savittha.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Sattipanniya Thera[/div][p]An arahant.  One hundred thousand kappas ago he offered a satti flower to the body of the Buddha (? Padumuttara) when it was being taken for cremation (Ap.ii.406).  [/p][p]He is evidently identical with Vimala Thera.  ThagA.i.377.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Sammodamāna Jātaka (No.  33)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta was once a quail.  There was a fowler who enticed quails by imitating their cry and then throwing a net over them.  The Bodhisatta suggested that when the fowler did this, they should all fly away with the net.  This they did, and, day after day, the fowler returned empty handed till his wife grew angry.  One day, two of the quails started quarrelling, and the Bodhisatta, hearing their wrangling, decided to go elsewhere with his following.  When the fowler came again and spread his net, the two quails started quarrelling, and he was able to capture them.[/p][p]This was one of the, stories related at the time of the quarrel (Cumbatakalaha) between the Sākyans and the Koliyans (J.i.208 10).  See also the introductory story of the Kunāla Jātaka.  Elsewhere the story is called the Vattaka Jātaka.  E.g., J.v.414.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Sattubhasta Jātaka (No.  402)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta was once Senaka, counselor to Janaka, king of Benares.  He preached the Law once a fortnight, on fast days, and large numbers of people, including the king, went to hear him.[/p][p]An old brahmin, begging for alms, was given one thousand pieces.  He gave these to another brahmin to take care of, but the latter spent them, and when the owner came to ask for them, he gave his young daughter as wife, instead of the pieces.  This girl had a lover, and, in order to be able to see him, she asked her husband to go begging for a maid to help her in the house.  She filled a bag of provisions for the journey.  On his way home, having earned seven hundred pieces, the brahmin opened his bag, and after having eaten some of the food, went to a stream to drink, leaving the bag open.  A snake crept into the bag and lay there.  A tree sprite, thinking to warn the brahmin, said, "If you stop on the way you will die, if you return home your wife will die," and then disappeared.  Much alarmed, the brahmin went towards Benares, weeping along the way, and, as it was the fast day, people going to hear Senaka, directed the brahmin to him.  Senaka, hearing the brahmin's story, guessed the truth, and had the bag opened in front of the people.  The snake crept out and was seized.  To show his gratitude, the brahmin gave Senaka his seven hundred pieces, but Senaka gave them back with another three hundred, warning the brahmin not to take the money home.  He buried the money under a tree, but could not keep the secret from his wife.  She told her lover, and the money was stolen.  The brahmin again sought Senaka, who told him of a plan for discovering the lover, and when he was found, Senaka sent for him and made him confess his guilt.[/p][p]The story was related in reference to the Buddha's wisdom.  Ananda, was the brahmin and Sāriputta the tree sprite (J.iii.341 51).  The story is often referred to as exemplifying the Buddha's practice of the Perfection of paññā.  E.g., J.i.46; BuA.50f.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Satullapakāyikā[/div][p]A class of Devas.  The Samyutta contains (S.i.16 22) a whole group of suttas in which these devas are stated to have visited the Buddha, asking him several questions on different topics.[/p][p]Buddhaghosa says (SA.i.43f ) that, in a previous birth, they were a ship's crew on a trading line.  Their vessel was overwhelmed by stormy seas, and sank with all on board.  During the storm, the terrified crew saw one of their number seated like a yogi, calm and self possessed.  On being asked what he thought of, he said he thought of the good deeds he had done before starting on the voyage.  These would ensure him happy rebirth, so why should he worry? The others then implored his assistance and compassion.  He divided them into seven groups of one hundred each, and shouted to them, above the tempest, the Five Precepts, assuring them that their sīla would bring them to a happy dawn.  They took the precepts as the waters rose, and were reborn in Sakka's heaven, in different groups, each with his own vimāna.  Their teacher had a golden vimāna of one hundred leagues in the middle of the others.  As soon as born they realized the reason for their happiness, and visited the Buddha in order to praise their wonderful teacher.  They were called Satullapā because they shouted the precepts while divided in groups of one hundred (sata ullapā).[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Sañjaya Belatthiputta[/div][p]One of the six famous heretical teachers of the Buddha's day.  He was a great skeptic, his teaching being the evasion of problems and the suspension of judgment.  His doctrines seem to have been identical with those of the Amarāvikkhepikas (Eel wrigglers) who, when asked a question, would equivocate and wriggle like an eel.  Sañjaya's teachings are given at D.i.58; cf.  the "Eel wrigglers" at D.i.27.[/p][p]It is probable that Sañjaya suspended his judgments only with regard to those questions the answers to which must always remain a matter of speculation.  It may be that he wished to impress on his followers the fact that the final answer to these questions lay beyond the domain of speculation, and that he wished to divert their attention from fruitless enquiry and direct it towards the preservation of mental equanimity.  [/p][p]Buddhaghosa gives us no particulars about Sañjaya, beyond the fact that he was the son of Belattha (DA.i.144).  Sanskrit texts call him Sañjayī Vairatiputra (E.g., Mtu.iii.59f) and Sañjayi Vairattīputra (E.g., Dvy.  143,145).[/p][p]He is evidently identical with Sañjaya the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/paribbajaka,Paribbājaka')"]Paribbājaka[/a] who was the original teacher of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta,Sāriputta')"]Sāriputta[/a] and  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_moggallana_th,Moggallāna')"]Moggallāna[/a] (Vin.i.39).  It is said that when these two disciples left Sañjaya to become pupils of the Buddha, they were joined by two hundred and fifty others.  Sañjaya then fainted, and hot blood issued from his mouth.  Vin.i.42; according to DhA.i.78, Sāriputta and Moggallāna tried to persuade Sañjaya to accept the Buddha's doctrine, but they failed, and only one half of his disciples joined them.  The Paribbājaka  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suppiya,Suppiya')"]Suppiya[/a] was also a follower of Sañjaya (DA.i.35).[/p][p]Barua thinks (Op.  cit., 326) that the Aviruddhakas mentioned in the Anguttara (A.iii.276) were also followers of Sañjaya - that they were called Amarāvikkhepakā for their philosophical doctrines, and Aviruddhakā for their moral conduct.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Sādhusīla Jātaka (No.  200)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta was once a famous brahmin teacher.  A certain brahmin had four daughters who were wooed by four suitors one handsome, another advanced in years, another of noble family, and the last virtuous.  Unable to decide between them, the brahmin sought the teacher's advice and gave all his four daughters to the virtuous man.[/p][p]The story was related to a brahmin of Sāvatthi who consulted the Buddha in a similar case.  The two brahmins were identical.  J.i.137f.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Sahassayāga Sutta[/div][p]Evidently a name given to one of the Satullapakāyika Suttas (S.i.19), in which the Buddha praises the worth of a small but righteous gift as being far greater than large gifts made un-righteously.  [/p][p]A stanza from this sutta is quoted in the Bilārikosiya Jātaka (J.iv.66) and in the Mahāvamsa Tīkā.  MT.596.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Samacitta(pariyāya) Sutta[/div][p]A large number of Devas of Tranquil Mind (Samacittā) come to the Buddha at Jetavana and ask him if he will visit Sāriputta, who is preaching at the Migāramātupāsāda on the person who is fettered both inwardly and outwardly.  The Buddha agrees in silence and appears at the Migāramātupāsāda.  Sāriputta greets the Buddha and salutes him.  The Buddha relates to him the visit of the Devas and tells him that a large number of them can stand in a space not greater than the point of a gimlet, and that, too, without crowding each other.  This is because they have trained themselves to be tranquil in the senses and in the mind.  Such tranquillity leads to tranquillity also of body, speech, and thought.  Followers of other schools do not know this teaching (A.i.64f).[/p][p]In the discourse of Sāriputta, (A.i.62f) referred to by the Devas, the Elder explains that the monk who keeps the Pātimokkha restraints is proficient in the practice of right conduct, seeing danger in the slightest faults such a one is reborn among the Devas and is therefore a "Returner." Thus he is fettered inwardly to the self.  Others there are who are born in Deva worlds and there become anāgāmīs.  These are fettered outwardly.  Yet others are proficient in revulsion, in the ending of sensuality, of any existence and become anāgāmīs.[/p][p]It is said (AA.i.320; cf.  SNA., p.174; Mil.  p.20) that at the conclusion of this sutta, as at the conclusion of the Mahāsamaya, Mangala, and Cūla Rāhulovāda Suttas, one hundred thousand crores attained arahantship.[/p][p]The sutta was preached by Mahinda on the evening of his arrival in Ceylon.  After his interview with Devānampiyatissa, Mahinda asked Sumana sāmanera to announce the preaching of the Dhamma.  This announcement was heard throughout the Island, and gradually the news of it spread to Brahmā's heaven.  There was then an assembly of Devas, just as on the occasion of Sāriputta's preaching of the sutta.  Mhv.xiv.34ff.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Sālapupphiya Thera[/div][p]An arahant.  He was a confectioner of Arunavatī in the time of Siddhattha Buddha, to whom he gave a sāla flower.[/p][p]Fourteen kappas ago he was a king named Amitañjala.  Ap.i.218f.  [/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Sappadāsa Thera[/div][p]He was born in Kapilavatthu as the son of Suddhodana's chaplain.  He received faith on the occasion of the Buddha's visit to his own people, and entered the Order.  Overmastered by corrupt habits of mind and character, for twenty five years he was unable to develop concentration.  This so distressed him that he was about to commit suicide, when, inward vision suddenly expanding, he attained arahantship (Thag.  vs.  405 10. ThagA.i.448f).  According to the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.ii.256f), he tried to kill himself by making a snake, caught by the monks, bite him.  But the snake refused to bite, in spite of all efforts to provoke him.  Sappadāsa then threw it away, thinking it to be non poisonous.  But the other monks declared it was a cobra, because they had seen its hood and heard its hissing.[/p][p]Sappadāsa acted as barber to the monastery, and, one day, taking a razor, he applied it to his windpipe as he leaned against a tree.  And then he thought how blameless his life had been and was filled with joy.  Thereupon he developed insight and became an arahant.  When the monks reported this to the Buddha, the Buddha said that the snake had been the Elder's slave in his third previous life, and therefore did not dare bite him.  This incident gave the monk his name, Sappadāsa.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Sātimattiya Thera[/div][p]He belonged to a brahmin family of Magadha and, after entering the Order, lived in the forest and developed the six fold abhiññā.  Thereupon he instructed monks and preached to large numbers of lay people.  One family in particular he converted to the Faith, and in that family he was waited on respectfully by a beautiful girl.  Māra, wishing to disgrace him, once went to the house disguised as the Elder, and grasped the girl's hand.  But she, feeling that the touch was not human, took her hand away.  The others, however, saw this and lost faith in the Thera.  He, all unconscious, was aware next day of their changed manner.  Discerning the work of Māra, he made them tell him what had happened.  The father begged his forgiveness, and said that henceforth he himself would wait on the Elder (ThagA.i.368 f.; verses ascribed to him are found in Thag.246 8).[/p][p]The Thera is evidently identical with Sumanatālavantiya of the Apadāna (Ap.ii.408).  Ninety four kappas ago he met Siddhattha Buddha and offered him a palmyra fan (tālavanta) covered with sumana flowers.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Sankicca [/div][hr][h4][b]1. Sankicca Thera[/b][/h4][p]He was born in a very eminent brahmin family of Sāvatthi.  His mother died just before his birth and was cremated, but he was found unburnt on the funeral pyre (Cf.  the story of Dabba).  The men who burnt his mother's body, turning the pyre over with sticks, pierced the womb and injured the pupil of the child's eye.  Hence his name (Sankunā chinnakkhikotitāya = Sankicco).  When he was discovered, they consulted soothsayers, who told them that if he lived in the household seven generations would be impoverished, but if he became a monk he would be the leader of five hundred.  At the age of seven he came to know of his mother's death and expressed a wish to join the Order.  His guardians agreeing to this, he was ordained under Sāriputta.  He won arahantship in the Tonsure hall (ThagA.i.533).[/p][p]At that time, thirty men of Sāvatthi, who had entered the Order and had practised the duties of higher ordination for four years, wished to engage in meditation.  The Buddha, foreseeing danger for them, sent them to Sāriputta.  Sāriputta advised them to take with them the novice Sankicca, and they reluctantly agreed.  After a journey of one hundred and twenty leagues, they came to a village of one thousand families, where they stayed at the request of the inhabitants, who provided all their needs.  At the beginning of the rains, the monks agreed among themselves not to talk to one another; if any among them fell ill, he was to strike a bell.  One day, as the monks were eating their meal on the banks of a neighbouring river, a poor man who had travelled far stood near them and they gave him some food.  He then decided to stay with them, but after two months, wishing to see his daughter, he left the monks without a word.  He travelled through a forest where lived five hundred robbers, who had vowed to offer a human sacrifice to a spirit of the forest.[/p][p]As soon as they saw him, they captured him and prepared for the sacrifice.  The man then offered to provide them with a victim of far higher status than himself, and led them to the monks.  Knowing their habits, he struck the bell and they all assembled.  When the robbers made known their design, each one of the monks offered himself as a victim, and in the end Sankicca, with great difficulty, persuaded the others to let him go.  The thieves took Sankicca, and, when all was ready, the leader approached him with drawn sword.  Sankicca entered into samādhi, and when the blow was struck, the sword buckled and bent at the end and split from hilt to top.  Marvelling at this, the thieves did obeisance to Sankicca, and, after listening to his preaching, asked leave to be ordained.  Sankicca agreed to this, and, having ordained them, took them to the other monks.  There he took leave of them and went with his following to the Buddha.  In due course, Sankicca received the higher ordination, and ten years later he ordained his sister's son, Atimuttaka (Adhimuttaka), who, likewise, ordained five hundred thieves.  DhA.ii.240ff.; for the story of Atimuttaka see Sankicca's story is often referred to - e.g., Vsm.313; J.vi.14.[/p][p]The  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nagapeta_v,Nāgapeta Vatthu')"]Nāgapeta Vatthu[/a] contains a story of another of Sankicca's pupils (PvA.53ff).  The Theragāthā (Thag.  vs.  597-607) contains a series of stanzas spoken by Sankicca in praise of the charms of the forest in reply to a layman who, wishing to wait upon him, wished him to dwell in the village.[/p][p]Sankicca is one of the four novices mentioned in the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/catusaamanera_va,Catusāmanera Vatthu')"]Catusāmanera Vatthu[/a].

  <e>[div class="huge"]Sangāmaji Thera[/div][p]He was the son of a very rich setthi of Benares.  When he came of age, his parents married him and he had a son.  One day he joined a party of people going to Jetavana, and, at the conclusion of the Buddha's sermon, asked the Buddha to ordain him.  But the Buddha wished him to have his parent's leave.  This he obtained only with the greatest difficulty and with the promise to visit them later.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Saddhā Tissa[/div][p]1. King of Ceylon (77 59 B.C.).  He was the brother of Dutthagāmanī and was about a year younger.  When he was ten, at the ceremony of initiation, he was forced to make a vow that he would never fight against his brother; but when his father, Kākavannatissa, died, he seized the throne in the absence of Dutthagāmanī.  Up to that time he had been in charge of the Dīghavāpi district.  Dutthagāmanī now made war upon him, but was defeated at Cūlanganiyapitthi.  Later the tide turned, and Tissa had to flee to a monastery.  Dutthagāmanī surrounded the monastery, but some young monks carried Tissa out on a bed, covered up like a dead body.  Gāmanī discovered the ruse, but refrained from action.  Through the intervention of Godhagatta Tissa Thera, the brothers were reconciled, and, thereafter, seem to have been devoted to one another.[/p][p]After Gāmanī's conquest of Anurādhapura, Tissa seems to have returned as governor of Dīghavāpi.  When Gāmanī lay dying, Tissa was sent for to complete the work of the Mahā Thūpa, that the king might see it before his death.  This he got done by means of temporary structures, cunningly devised.  He was enjoined to retain unimpaired all the services on behalf of the religion inaugurated by his brother, and, when the latter died, he was succeeded by Tissa, who ruled for eighteen years.  He rebuilt the Lohapāsāda after it was burnt down, and erected many vihāras - Dakkhināgiri, Kallakālena, Kalambaka, Pettangavālika, Velangavitthika, Dubbalavāpitissaka, Dūratissaka, Mātuvihāraka and Dīghavāpi.  He built a vihāra to every yojana on the road from Anurādhapura to Dīghavāpi.  He had two sons, Lañjatissa and Thūlathana.[/p][p]Tissa was reborn after death in Tusita, and will be the second Chief Disciple of Metteyya Buddha.  Mhv.xxii.73, 83; xxiv2ff.; xxxii.83; xxxiii.4 17; Dpv.xx 2, 4ff.  [/p][p]He was a very pious king, entirely devoted to the cause of religion.  Various stories are mentioned about him in the Commentaries (See, e.g., Kālabuddharakkhita).  He once walked five leagues to Mangana to pay his respects to Kujjatissa (q.v.) (AA.i.384f).  On another occasion, he gave snipe to a novice from Kanthaka sālaparivena who would, however, accept only very little.  Pleased with his moderation, the king paid him great honour (AA.i.264).  He seems to have been specialty fond of the monks of Cetiyagiri (See VibhA.473).  He was, apparently, also known as Dhammika Tissa.  Dhammika Tissa once distributed one hundred cartloads of sugar (gula) among twelve thousand monks.  A seven year old novice was sent by a monk who had just come to Cetiyagiri from Anurādhapura to fetch for him some sugar, about the size of a kapittha fruit.  The attendant offered to give him a plateful, but the novice refused to take so much.  The king heard the conversation, and, pleased with the novice, sent a further four hundred cartloads of sugar to be given to the Order (E.g., SA.iii.48).  See also the story of Kukkutagiri.[/p][hr][p][b]2. Saddhātissa[/b].-A minister.  He once gave to Pindapatikatissa Thera of Sudassanapadhanasala a bowl of food which he had bought for 8 kahapanas.  The monk became an arahant before eating it.  The deity of the king's parasol applauded and king Saddhātissa having sent for him gave him the district of Vaddhamanananagara.  Later he shared with 30,000 monks water brought to him by the devas during a drought.  The king hearing of this gave him Antaraganga.  Sometime afterwards he became a sotāpanna, gladdened by the sight of 12,000 monks walking round Ambatthala cetiya clad in robes given by him.  Ras.ii.9f.[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Saccankira Jātaka (No.  73)[/div][p]The king of Benares had a son called Dutthakumāra, who was hated by everyone.  One day, when he was bathing in the river, a storm came on, and he ordered his servants to take him into the middle of the river and there bathe him.  The servants thereupon flung him into the water and reported to the king that he was lost.  As he was swept along on the stream, he caught hold of a tree trunk, and on to this tree trunk there came to cling, also, a snake, a rat, and a parrot, who had all lost their dwelling places in the storm.  The Bodhisatta, who was an ascetic living on the bank of the river, rescued Duttha and his companions and looked after them.  When they bade him farewell, the snake said that he had forty crores hidden in a certain spot, and the ascetic had only to ask for these and they were hits.  The rat had thirty crores, also at the ascetic's disposal; the parrot promised the ascetic wagonloads of rice; and Duttha promised to provide him with the four requisites.  In his heart, however, he hated the ascetic for an imaginary slight, and vowed vengeance.[/p][p]After Duttha became king, the ascetic wished to test the faith of his former guests.  He went to the snake and called out his name, and the snake at once appeared, offering his treasure.  The rat and the parrot did likewise, but Duttha, riding in a procession and seeing him from afar, gave orders that the ascetic should be beaten and put to death.  On his way to the place of execution the ascetic kept on repeating: "They knew the world who framed this proverb true: a log pays better salvage than some men!" When asked what these words meant, he related the whole story.[/p][p]The enraged citizens, seizing Duttha, put him to death and made the ascetic king.  Later, he brought the snake, the rat, and the parrot to the palace and looked after them.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to Devadatta's attempts to kill the Buddha.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Sarabha[/div][p]A Paribbājaka who joined the Order and soon after left it.  He then went about proclaiming in Rājagaha that he knew the Dhamma and Vinaya of the Sākyaputta monks, and that was why he had left their Order.  The Buddha, being told of this, visited the Paribbājakārāma, on the banks of the Sappinikā, and challenged Sarabha to repeat his statement.  Three times the challenge was uttered, but Sarabha sat silent.  The Buddha then declared to the Paribbājakas that no one could say that his claim to Enlightenment was unjustified, or that his dhamma, if practised, did not lead to the destruction of Ill.  After the Buddha's departure, the Paribbājakas taunted and abused Sarabha (A.i.185ff).[/p][p]It is said (AA.i.412 f ) that Sarabha joined the Order at the request of the Paribbājakas.  They had failed to find any fault with the Buddha's life, and thought that his power was due to an "āvattanīmāyā," which he and his disciples practised once a fortnight behind closed doors.  Sarabha agreed to find it out and learn it.  He therefore went to Gijjhakūta, where he showed great humility to all the resident monks.  An Elder, taking pity on him, ordained him.  In due course he learned the pātimokkha, which, he realized, was what the Paribbājakas took to be the Buddha's "māyā." Having learned it, he went back to the Paribbājakas, taught it to them, and with them went about in the city boasting that he knew the Buddha's teaching and had found it worthless.[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Samantakūta, Samantagiri, Sumanakūta, Sumanagiri, Sumanācala[/div][p]A mountain peak in Ceylon.  It was the residence of the Deva Mahāsumana (Mhv.i.33) and when the Buddha visited the Island for the third time, he left on the mountain the mark of his footprint (Mhv.i.77; cf.  Nammadā, and Saccabaddha).  Owing to this, the mountain became a sacred place of pilgrimage.  In later times many kings of Ceylon paid the shrine great honour.  Vijayabāhu I.  gifted the village of Gilīmalaya for the feeding of pilgrims, and set up rest-houses for them on the different routes, for the maintenance of which he provided.  (Cv.ix.64f)[/p][p]Kittinissanka made a special pilgrimage to Sumanakūta and mentioned it in his inscriptions (Cv.lxxx.24; Cv.Trs.ii.128, n.4).  Parakkamabāhu II.  did likewise, and also gave ten gāvutas of rich land for the shrine on the top of the peak (Cv.lxxxv.118).  He further gave orders to his pious minister, Devappatirāja, to make the roads leading to the mountain easy of access.  The minister repaired the roads, and built bridges at Bodhitala over the Khajjotanadī, at Ullapanaggāma, and at Ambaggāma.  He constructed rest houses at suitable spots, and placed stepping stones on the way to the summit.  Then the king himself visited the peak and held a great festival there lasting for three days (Cv.lxxxvi.9, 18 ff).  Vijayabāhu IV., too, made a pilgrimage to the sacred mountain (Cv.lxxxviii.48).[/p][p]King Vīravikkama also went there and lit a lamp, fifteen cubits in girth and five cubits high (Cv.xcii.17).  Rājasūha I., in his desire to take revenge on the Buddhist monks, handed the shrine over to Hindu priests (Cv.xciii.12), but Vimaladhammasūriya II.  restored to it all honours and held a great festival, lasting for seven days, at the peak (Cv.xcvii.16f).  His son, Narindasīha, made two pilgrimages there (Cv.xcvii.31), while Vijayarājasīha had a feast of lamps celebrated there (Cv.xcviii.84).  Kittisirirājasīha had a mandapa built round the footprint surmounted by a parasol, and assigned the revenues from the village of Kuttāpiti to the monks who looked after the shrine (Cv.c.221).[/p][p]The districts round Samantakūta were, in early times, the habitation of the Pulindas.  It was believed (Mhv.vii.67) that, when Vijaya forsook Kuvenī, her children fled thither and that their descendants were the Pulindas.  In later times, too, mention is made (E.g., Cv.lxi.70) of the fact that the people dwelling in the neighbourhood of Samantakūtta refused to pay taxes to the king.  From very early times the mountain was the dwelling of numerous monks.  Thus, in the time of Dutthagāmanī, there were nine hundred monks there, under Malayamahādeva Thera (Mhv.xxxii.49).  The Damila Dīghajantu offered a red robe to the Ākāsacetiya in Samantagiri vihāra, and, as a result, won heaven, because he remembered the gift at the moment of his death (AA.i.376; MA.ii.955).  The rivers Mahāvāluka and Kalyāni rise in Sumanakūta.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Sandaka Sutta[/div][p]Ananda, staying at the Ghositārāma in Kosambī, visits the Pilakkhaguhā near Devakata pool, where the Paribbājaka Sandaka is staying with some five hundred followers.  Ananda is asked to give a discourse on the Buddha's teachings, and speaks of the four antitheses to the higher life: there is the teacher who holds that it does not matter whether actions are good or bad; the teacher who holds that no evil is done by him who acts himself or causes others to act; the teacher holding that there is no cause for either depravity or purity; and, lastly, the teacher who holds, among other things, that men make an end of ill only when they have completed their course of transmigrations, like a ball of twine which continues rolling as long as there is string to unwind.  On these heresies cf.  Sāleyyaka Sutta.  The reference is evidently to the teachings of Purāna Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla and others.[/p][p]Ananda then proceeds to explain the four comfortless vocations: the teacher who claims to be all knowing and all seeing; the teacher whose doctrine is traditional and scriptural; the rationalist of pure reason and criticism teaching a doctrine of his own reasoning; and, lastly, the teacher who is stupid and deficient.  Ananda then describes the Buddha's own teaching, leading up to the four Jhānas.  Sandaka and his followers accept the Buddha as their teacher.  M.i.513-24.[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Sasa( pandita) Jātaka (No.  316)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta was once born as a Hare.  He lived with three friends: a Monkey, a Jackal, and an Otter.  The three lived in great friendship, and the Hare was their guide in the good life.  One day, the Hare, observing the approach of the full moon, told his friends that the next day would be a fast day and that they must collect food and give it to any beggar who approached them.  The animals all went out very early in the morning, one by one; the Otter found some fish buried in the sand; the Jackal a dead lizard, some meat, and a pot of curds; and the Monkey some fruits; and, finding that nobody appeared to claim them, each took them to his own dwelling.  The Hare had only kusa grass, which he could not offer to anyone.  He therefore decided to give his own body, and, because of this brave decision, Sakka's throne was heated.  Disguised as a brahmin, he came to test the Hare.  He went first to the other animals in turn and they all offered him what they had.  He then approached the Hare, whom he asked for food.  The Hare asked him to collect faggots from the wood and make a fire.  Then, telling the brahmin that he would give him his own body, without the brahmin having the necessity of killing him, he shook out any animals which might lurk in his fur, and then jumped into the fire as into a lotusbed.  By the power of Sakka, the fire remained as cool as snow, and Sakka revealed his identity.  Then, so that the Hare's nobility might be known to all the world, he took some essence of the Himālaya and painted the form of a hare in the moon, to remain there during this whole kappa.  Having done this, he went to the Hare and talked of the Doctrine, and then, making the Hare lie down on his bed of grass, Sakka went back to his heaven.[/p][p]The story was related in the course of giving thanks to a landowner of Sāvatthi who had entertained the Buddha and his monks for seven days.  Ananda is identified with the Otter, Moggallāna with the Jackal, and Sāriputta with the Monkey (J.iii.51 6).[/p][p]The story is included in the Cariyāpitaka (i.10) and in the Jātakamālā (No.  6).

  <e>[div class="huge"]Sankassa[/div][p]A city, thirty leagues from Sāvatthi.  (DhA.iii.224).  It was there that the Buddha returned to earth, after preaching the Abhidhamma Pitaka in Tāvatimsa, following the performance of the Twin Miracle under the Gandamba tree.  As the time approached for the Buddha to leave Tāvatimsa , Moggallāna (Anuruddha, according to SNA.ii.570; cf.  Vsm., p.391) announced his coming return to the multitude, who had been waiting at Sāvatthi, fed by Culla Anāthapindika, while Moggallāna expounded the Dhamma.  They then made their way to Sankassa.  The descent of the Buddha took place on the day of the Mahāpavārana festival.  Sakka provides three ladders for the Buddha's descent from Sineru.  to the earth: on the right was a ladder of gold for the gods; on the left a silver ladder for Mahā Brahmā and his retinue; and in the middle a ladder of jewels for the Buddha.  The assembled people covered the earth for thirty leagues round.  There was a clear view of the nine Brahma worlds above and of Avīci below.  The Buddha was accompanied by Pañcasikha, Mātali, Mahā Brahmā and Suyāma.  Sāriputta was the first to welcome him (followed by Uppalavannā, SNA.ii.570), and the Buddha preached the Law, starting with what was within the comprehension even of a puthujjana, and ending with what only a Buddha could understand.  On this occasion was preached the Parosahassa Jātaka (q.v.) to proclaim to the multitude the unparalleled wisdom of Sāriputta (DhA.iii.224ff.; see also SNA.ii.570).  It is said' that the Buddha's descent to Sankassa had provided opportunity for Moggallāna to show his eminence in iddhi, Anuruddha in dibbacakkhu, and Punna in skill in preaching, and the Buddha wished to give Sāriputta a chance of shining in his wisdom.  (Ibid., loc.  cit.; J.iv.266; see also Jhānasodhana, Sarabhamiga, and Candābha Jātakas).  He therefore asked of Sāriputta questions which no one else could answer.  The opening words of the Sāriputta Sutta (q.v.) are supposed to refer to this descent from Tusita (sic).  The site of the city gate of Sankassa is one of the "unchangeable" spots of the world (avijahitatthānam).  All Buddhas descend at that spot to the world of men after preaching the Abhidhamma (BuA.106, 247; MA.i.371, etc.).  From Sankassa the Buddha went to Jetavana (J.i.193).  A shrine was erected on the spot where the Buddha's right foot first touched the ground at Sankassa (DhA.iii.227).  When the Chinese pilgrims, Hiouen Thsang and Fa Hien, visited the place, they found three ladders, which had been built of brick and stone by the ancients, to commemorate the Buddha's descent, but the ladders were nearly sunk in the earth.  (Beal, op.  cit., i.203; Fa Hien, p.24).[/p][p]There was, in the Buddha's time, a deer park at Sankassa where Suhemanta Thera heard the Buddha preach (ThagA.i.212).  During the Vajjiputta controversy, Revata Thera, on his way from Soreyya to Sahājāti, went through Sankassa.  The road he took passed through Sankassa, Kannakujja, Udumbarā and Aggālapura (Vin.ii.299f).[/p][p]Sankassa is now identified with Sankissa Basantapura on the north bank of the Ikkhumatī (Kālīnadī), between Atranji and Kanoj, twenty-three miles west of Fatehgarh and forty five north of Kanoj.[/p]</e>

But finding that he was offered nothing, he asked the Bodhisatta for some and ate it.  As soon as he had finished he was seized with remorse that he should thus have disgraced his family.  So greatly was he upset that he vomited the food, and with it some blood.  He plunged into the wood and was never heard of again.[/p][p]The story was related in reference to monks who earned their living in the twenty one unlawful ways, as physicians, messengers, etc.  The Buddha summoned them and warned that food unlawfully come by was like red hot iron, a deadly poison.  It was like partaking of the leavings of the vilest of mankind.  J.ii.82 5.[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Santati[/div][p]A minister of Pasenadi.  Because he quelled a frontier disturbance, the king gave over the kingdom to him for seven days, and gave him a woman skilled in song and dance.  For seven days Santati enjoyed himself, drinking deeply; on the seventh day he went to the bathing place fully adorned, riding the state elephant.  The Buddha met him on the way, and Santati saluted him from the elephant.  The Buddha smiled and passed on.  When questioned by Ananda, the Buddha answered that on that very day Santati would attain arahantship and die.[/p][p]Santati spent part of the day amusing himself in the water, and then sat in the drinking hall of the park.  The woman came on the stage and sang and danced, but she had fasted for seven days to acquire more grace of body, and, as she danced, she fell down dead.  Santati was overwhelmed with a mighty sorrow, and straightway became sober.  He then sought the Buddha for consolation in his grief.  The Buddha preached a four line stanza, and Santati attained arahantship and asked the Buddha's permission to pass into nibbāna.  The Buddha agreed, on condition that he rose into the air and told to the assembled people the story of his past life.  Santati agreed to this, and, rising to a height of seven palm trees, related the meritorious deed of his past life.[/p][p]Ninety kappas ago, in the time of Vipassī Buddha, he was a householder of Bandhumatī, and became a follower of the Buddha and went about proclaiming the virtues of the Three Refuges.  King Bandhumā met him and gave him a garland of flowers to wear and a horse on which to ride, while proclaiming the Law.  He later gave him a chariot, great wealth, beautiful jewels and an elephant.  Thus, for eighty four thousand years, Santati went about preaching the Dhamma, and there was diffused from his body the fragrance of sandalwood, and from his mouth the fragrance of the lotus.[/p][p]As he related his story, seated cross legged in the air, he developed the idea of fire and passed into nibbāna.  Flames burst from his body and burnt it up.  The Buddha had his relics collected and a shrine built for them at the meeting of four highways.  Discussion arose as to whether Santati should be called a brahmin or a monk.  The Buddha said that both names were equally appropriate.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Sambara[/div][p]A chief of the Asuras.  In the "Isayo Samuddakā Sutta” (S.i.227) (q.v.) we are told that, because Sambara refused the request of the sages for a guarantee of safety, they cursed him, and his mind was deranged.  Buddhaghosa adds (SA.i.266) that, on account of this mental derangement, he came to be called Vepacitti (s.v.).  Elsewhere (S.i.239), however, it is said that once Sakka asked Vepacitti to teach him Sambara's magic art (Sambarimāyā).  Vepacitti consulted the Asuras and then warned Sakka against learning it because, through his art, Sambara had fallen into purgatory, where he had been suffering for a century.  Buddhaghosa, in this context (SA.i.272), calls Sambara an Asurinda, a juggler (māyāvī) who, having practised his māyā, has roasted for the past century in purgatory.[/p][p]Mrs.  Rhys Davis (KS.i.306 n) thinks there was a rank of Sambara resembling that of Sakka, and that each succeeding Sambara learnt the magic art.

There was a Paribbājaka, named Kātiyāna, whom he had known as a layman, and Kātiyāna, having become destitute after the Buddha's appearance in the world, asked Sāmaññakāni what he could do to get happiness in this world and the next.  His friend answered that he should follow the Noble Eightfold Path (Thag.vs.35; ThagA.i.98f).  We are told (ThagA.i.450) that Kātiyāna later joined the Order and became an arahant.[/p][p]Sāmaññakāni is evidently identical with Mañcadāyaka (Pecchadāyaka) of the Apadāna (Ap.i.455).

By means of a counter question, the Buddha finds from Ajātasattu that even if a servant of his joined the Order, he would receive the king's honour and respect.  Then the Buddha proceeds to show, step by step, the fruits higher and nobler, which await the samana, immediate in their effect, culminating in the six fold abhiññā of the arahant.  The king is greatly impressed, takes refuge in the Buddha, and expresses his remorse for having killed his father.  The Buddha utters no word of blame, but after the departure of the king, he informs the monks that if Ajātasattu had not been guilty of patricide he would have realized the first fruit of the Path (D.i.47 86).[/p][p]The Commentary adds (DA.i.238) that as a result of hearing this discourse, Ajātasattu would, in the future, become a Pacceka Buddha named Viditavisesa.  From this moment, Ajātasattu was one of the Buddha's most devoted followers.  It is said that, after his father's death, Ajātasattu could never sleep at night until he had heard the Buddha, after which he enjoyed peaceful sleep.[/p]</e>

On the day of the dedication of Jetavana, he heard the Buddha preach and left the world.  After ordination he mastered the two categories (of Vinaya rules), and, after obtaining a subject for meditation, lived in the forest.  There he developed insight, and attained arahantship on the basis of mettā-jhāna.  Teaching the Dhamma without distinction or limitation, he was declared chief of those who lived remote and in peace (aranavihārinam aggo), and of those who were worthy of gifts (dakkhineyyānam) (A.i.24; cf.  Ud.vi.7, where the Buddha commends his proficiency in meditation).  It is said that when he went begging for alms he would develop mettā-jhāna at each door, hence every gift made to him was of the highest merit.  In the course of his travels he came to Rājagaha, and Bimbisāra promised to build him a dwelling-place.  But the king forgot his promise, and Subhūti meditated in the open air.

He asked one of his monks, proficient in mettā and eminent in receiving gifts, to preach the anumodanā.  At the end of the sermon all the other hermits became arahants, but Nanda's attention was fixed on the majesty of the preaching monk, and he did not reach any attainment.

At once the king sends him with an escort and a present and a tablet of gold on which the answer may be written.  Sucīrata visits other sages on the way, and finally Vidhura, who had been his school mate.  When the question is asked, Vidhura refers it to his son Bhadrakāra, who, however, is busy with an intrigue with a woman and cannot give attention to the matter.  He sends Sucīrata to his younger brother, Sañjaya, but he, too, is occupied, and sends him on to his brother Sambhava (the Bodhisatta), a boy of seven.  Sucīrata finds him playing in the street, but when he is asked the question, he answers it with all the fluent mastery of a Buddha.  All Benares, including the king, hears the answer and stays to listen.  Sambhava is paid great honour and receives many presents.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Sokyā, Sakka, Sākiyā[/div][p]A tribe in North India, to which the Buddha belonged.  Their capital was Kapilavatthu.  Mention is also made of other Sākyan settlements e.g., Cātumā, Khomadussa, Sāmagāma, Devadaha, Silāvatī, Nagaraka, Medatalumpa, Sakkhara and Ulumpa (q.v.).  Within the Sākyan tribe there were probably several clans, gottā.  The Buddha himself belonged to the Gotamagotta.  It has been suggested (E.g., Thomas, op.  cit., 22) that this was a brahmin clan, claiming descent from the ancient isi Gotama.  The evidence for this suggestion is, however, very meagre.  Nowhere do we find the Sākyans calling themselves brahmins.  On the other hand, we find various clans claiming a share of the Buddha's relics on the ground that they, like the Buddha, were khattiyas (D.ii.165).  It is stated a that the Sākyans were a haughty people.  Vin.ii.183; D.i.90; J.i.88; DhA.iii.163. Hiouen Thsang, however, found them obliging and gentle in manners (Beal, op.  cit., ii.14).[/p][p]When the Buddha first visited them, after his Enlightenment, they refused to honour him on account of his youth.  The Buddha then performed a miracle and preached the Vessantara Jātaka, and their pride was subdued.  They evidently fond of sports and mention is made of a special school of archery conducted by a Sākyan family, called Vedhaññā (D.iii.117; DA.iii.905).  When the prince Siddhattha Gotama (later the Buddha) wished to marry, no Sākyan would give him his daughter until he had showed his proficiency in sport (J.i.58).[/p][p]The Sākyans evidently had no king.  Theirs was a republican form of government, probably with a leader, elected from time to time.  The administration and judicial affairs of the gotta were discussed in their Santhāgāra, or Mote Hall, at Kapilavatthu.  See, e.g., D.i.91; the Sākyans had a similar Mote Hall at Cātumā (M.i.457).  The Mallas of Kusinārā also had a Santhāgāra (D.ii.164); so did the Licchavis of Vesāli (Vin.i.233; M.i.228).[/p][p]Ambattha (q.v.) once visited it on business; so did the envoys of Pasenadi, when he wished to marry a Sākyan maiden (see below).  A new Mote Hall was built at Kapilavatthu while the Buddha was staying at the Nigrodhārāma, and he was asked to inaugurate it.  This he did by a series of ethical discourses lasting through the night, delivered by himself, Ananda, and Moggallāna.  M.i.353f.; S.iv.182f; the hall is described at SA.iii.63; cf.  UdA.409.[/p][p]The Sākyans were very jealous of the purity of their race; they belonged to the Ādiccagotta, (Ādiccā nāma gottena, Sākiyā nāma jātiyā, SN.  vs.423) and claimed descent from Okkāka (q.v.).  Their ancestors were the nine children of Okkāka, whom he banished in order to give the kingdom to Jantukumāra, his son by another queen.  These nine children went towards Himavā, and, having founded Kapilavatthu (q.v.  for details), lived there.  To the eldest sister they gave the rank of mother, and the others married among themselves.  The eldest sister, Piyā, later married Rāma, king of Benares, and their descendants became known as the Koliyans (see Koliyā for details).  When Okkāka heard of this, he praised their action, saying, "Sakyā vata bho kumārā, paramasakyā vata bho rājakumāra; hence their name came to be "Sakyā."[/p][p]SNA.i.352f.; cf.  DA.i.258. Okkāka had a slave girl, Disā, her offspring were the Kanhāyanas, to which gotta belonged Ambattha (q.v.).  The Mhv.ii.12ff gives the history of the direct descent of the Buddha from Okkāka, and this contains a list of the Sākyan chiefs of Kapilavatthu: [/p][ul][li]Okkāmukha was Okkāka's eldest son; [/li][li]Nipuna, Candimā, Candamukha, Sivisañjaya, Vessantara, Jāli, Sīhavāhana and Sīhassara were among his descendants.  [/li][li]Sīhassara had eighty-two thousand sons and grandsons, of whom Jayasena was the last.  [/li][li]Jayasena's son was Sīhahanu, and his daughter Yasodharā.  [/li][li]Sīhahanu's wife was Kaccāna, daughter of Devadahasakka of Devadaha, whose son Añjana married Yasodharā.  [/li][li]Añjana had two sons, Dandapāni and Suppabuddha, and two daughters, [/li][li]Māyā and Pajāpatī.  [/li][li]Sīhahanu had five sons and two daughters: Suddhodana, Dhotodana, Sakkodana, Sukkodana, Amitodana, Amitā and Pamitā.  [/li][li]Māyā and Pajāpatī were married to Suddhodana, and Māyā's son was the Buddha.  [/li][li]Suppabuddha married Amitā and they had two children, Bhaddakaccānā and Devadatta.  [/li][li]The consort of the Bodhisatta was Bhaddakaccānā; their son was Rāhula.[/li][/ul][p]From the very first there seems to have been intermarriage between the Sākyans and the Koliyans; but there was evidently a good deal of endogamy among the Sākyans, which earned for them the rebuke of the Koliyans in the quarrel between them "like dogs, jackals, and such like beasts, cohabiting with their own sisters.  E.g., SNA.i.357; J.v.412 L; there were eighty two thousand rājās among the Koliyans and Sākyans (SNA.i.140).[/p][p]A quarrel, which broke out in the Buddha's lifetime, between the Sākyans and the Koliyans is several times referred to in the books.  The longest account is found in the introductory story of the Kunāla Jātaka.  The cause of the dispute was the use of the water of the River Rohinī (q.v.), which flowed between the two kingdoms.  The quarrel waxed fierce, and a bloody battle was imminent, when the Buddha, arriving in the air between the two hosts, asked them, "Which is of more priceless value, water or khattiya chiefs?" He thus convinced them of their folly and made peace between them.  On this occasion he preached five Jātaka stories - the Phandana, Daddabha, Latukika, Rukkhadhamma and Vattaka (Sammodamāna) - and the Attadanda Sutta.  [/p][p]To show their gratitude the Sākyans and Koliyans gave each two hundred and fifty young men from their respective families to join the Order of the Buddha.  (J.v.412f.; for their history see also SNA.i.358f ) Earlier, during the Buddha's first visit to Kapilavatthu, when he had humbled the pride of his kinsmen by a display of miracles, each Sākyan family had given one representative to enter the Order and to help their famous kinsman.  The wives of these, and of other Sākyans who had joined the Order, were the first to become nuns under Pajāpatī Gotamī (q.v.) when the Buddha gave permission for women to enter the Order.  Among the most eminent of the Sākyan young men, who now joined, were Anuruddha, Ananda, Bhaddiya, Kimbila, Bhagu and Devadatta.  Their barber, Upāli, entered the Order at the same time; they arranged that he should be ordained first, so that he might be higher than they in seniority and thus receive their obeisance, and thereby humble their pride Vin.ii.181f.; according to DhA.i.133, eighty thousand Sākyan youths had joined the Order.[/p][p]The Buddha states, in the Aggañña Sutta, that the Sākyans were vassals of King Pasenadi of Kosala.  D.iii.83 (Sakyā .  .  .  Pasenadi-Kosalassa anuyuttā bhavanti, karonti Sakyā rañño Pasenadimhi Kosale nipaccakāram abhivādanam paccupatthānam añjalikammam sāmīcikammam); cf.  SN.vs 422, where the Buddha describes his country as being "Kosalesu niketino."[/p][p]Yet, when Pasenadi wished to establish connection with the Buddha's family by marrying one of the daughters of a Sākyan chief, the Sākyans decided in their Mote Hall that it would be beneath their dignity to marry one of their daughters to the King of Kosala.  But as they dared not refuse Pasenadi's request, the Sākyan chieftain, Mahānāma, solved the difficulty by giving him Vāsabhakhattiyā (q.v.), who was his daughter by a slave girl, Nāgamundā.  By her Pasenadi had a son, Vidūdabha.  When Pasenadi discovered the trick, he deprived his wife and her son of all their honours, but restored them on the intervention of the Buddha.  Later, when Vidūdabha, who had vowed vengeance on the Sākyans for the insult offered to his father, became king, he marched into Kapilavatthu and there massacred the Sākyans, including women and children.  The Buddha felt himself powerless to save them from their fate because they had committed sin in a previous life by throwing poison into a river.  Only a few escaped, and these came to be called the Nalasākiyā and the Tinasākiyā.  The Mhv.  Tīkā (p.  180) adds that, during this massacre, some of the Sākyans escaped to the Himālaya, where they built a city, which came to be called Moriyanagara because the spot resounded with the cries of peacocks.  This was the origin of the Moriya dynasty, to which Asoka belonged (189).  Thus Asoka and the Buddha were kinsmen.[/p][p]Among the Sākyans who thus escaped was Pandu, son of Amitodana.  He crossed the Ganges, and, on the other side of the river, founded a city.  His daughter was Bhaddakaccānā (q.v.), who later married Panduvāsudeva, king of Ceylon.  Thus the kings of Ceylon were connected by birth to the Sākyans.  Mhv.viii.18ff.  Six of her brothers also came to Ceylon, where they founded settlements: Rāma, Uruvela, Anurādha Vijita, Dīghāyu and Rohana (Mhv.ix 6ff.).[/p]</e>

One day, having received a present of rice and ghee, he took it home, made his fire blaze up, and put the rice into the fire.  The flames rose up and burnt his hut.  Deciding that the company of the wicked was dangerous, he put out the fire and went up into the mountains.  There he saw a hind licking the faces of a lion, a tiger, and a panther.

Amanda gives the news to the Buddha, who asks if there be any difference of opinion among monks regarding the Buddha's teaching.  "No," answers Ananda, but adds that such differences may arise after the Buddha's death.  The Buddha says that quarrels regarding rigours of regimen or of the Vinaya are of little concern.  It is quarrels regarding the Path or the course of training that are really important.  He then explains the six causes from which disputes grow, the four adjudications (adhikarana) regarding disputes, and the seven settlements of adjudication - by giving a summary verdict in the presence of the parties, a verdict of innocence, of past insanity; confession may be admitted; a chapter's decision may be taken; there is also specific wickedness and there is covering up.  Then there are six things which lead to conciliations: acts of love, words of love, sharing equally whatever gifts one receives, strict practice of virtue without flaw or blemish, and the holding of noble views which make for salvation (M.ii.243 51; cf.  the [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasadika_sutta,Pāsadika Sutta')"]Pāsadika Sutta[/a]).[/p][p] [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa,Buddhaghosa')"]Buddhaghosa[/a] adds (MA.ii.840) that, while in the [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambiya,Kosambiya Sutta')"]Kosambiya Sutta[/a] the Sotāpattimagga is called sammāditthi, in this sutta, Sotāpattiphala itself is so called.[/p][hr][p][b]2 Sāmagāma Sutta.[/b] The Buddha was once staying near the lotus pond at Sāmagāma and late at night is visited by a deva.

One day, the king discovered his skill and engaged his services to throw a pint pot of goat's dung into the mouth of a brahmin who never stopped talking.  The cripple sat behind a curtain through which he threw the pellets of dung as the brahmin talked.  Then the king told the brahmin, and he was cured of his talking and the cripple won great wealth.  Desiring gain, a certain man ministered to the cripple and learnt his art, and, when he left, the cripple warned him not to throw stones at anyone who had father or mother or owner.  While wandering about, the man came across the Pacceka Buddha Sunetta, and, thinking him a fit victim, threw a stone through his ear.  The Pacceka Buddha suffered great pain and died.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Sanankumāra[/div][p]A Mahā Brahmā.  In the Nikāyas (D.i.121; M.i.358; S.i.153; A.v.327) he is mentioned as the author of a famous verse, there quoted:[/p][dl][dd]Khattiyo settho jane tasmim ye gottapatisārino [/dd][dd]Vijjācaranasampanno so settho devamānuse.[/dd][/dl][p]In one place (S.ii.284) the verse is attributed to the Buddha, thus endowing it with the authoritativeness of a pronouncement by the Buddha himself.  Sanankumāra is represented as a very devout follower of the Buddha.  [/p][p]In a sutta of the Samyutta (S.i.153), he is spoken of as visiting the Buddha on the banks of the Sappinī, and it was during this visit that the above verse was spoken.  Sanankumāra was present at the preaching of the Mahāsamaya Sutta (D.ii.261).  [/p][p]In the Janavasabha Sutta, Janavasabha describes to the Buddha an occasion on which Sanankumāra attended an assembly of the Devas, presided over by Sakka and the Four Regent Gods.  There was suddenly a vast radiance, and the devas knew of the approach of Sanankumāra.  As the usual appearance of the Brahmā is not sufficiently materialized for him to be perceived by the Devas of Tāvatimsa, he is forced to appear as a relatively gross personality which he specially creates.  As he arrives, the Devas sit in their places with clasped hands waiting for him to choose his seat.  Then Sanankumāra takes on the form of Pañcasikha (because all devas like Pañcasikha, says the Commentary, DA.ii.640) and sits, above the assembly, cross legged, in the air.  So seated, he expresses his satisfaction that Sakka and all the Tāvatimsa Devas should honour and follow the Buddha.  His voice has all the eight characteristics of a Brahmā's voice.  (These are given at D.ii.211).  He then proceeds to create thirty three shaper, of himself, each sitting on the divan of a Tāvatimsa Deva, and addresses the Devas, speaking of the advantages of taking refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha.  Each deva fancies that only the shape sitting on his own divan has spoken and that the others are silent.  Then Sanankumāra goes to the end of the Hall, and, seated on Sakka's throne, addresses the whole assembly on the four ways of iddhi; on the three avenues leading to Bliss, as manifested by the Buddha; on the four satipatthānas, and the seven samādhiparikkhārā.  He declares that more than twenty four lakhs of Magadha disciples, having followed the teachings of the Buddha, have been born in the deva worlds.  When Sanankumāra has finished his address, Vessavana wonders if there have been Buddhas in the past and will be in the future.  The Brahmā reads his thoughts and says there certainly were and will be.[/p][p]Sanankumāra means "ever young." Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.584; cf.  SA.i.171) that, in his former birth, he practised jhānas while yet a boy with his hair tied in five knots (pañcacūlakakumārakāle), and was reborn in the Brahma world with the thāna intact.  He liked the guise of youth and continued in the same, hence the name.  Rhys Davids (Dial.ii.292, n.3; cf.i.121, n.1) sees in the legend of Sanankumāra the Indian counterpart of the European legend of Galahad.  The oldest mention of it is in the Chāndogya Upanisad (Chap.  VII), where the ideal, yet saintly knight, teaches a typical brahmin the highest truths.  In the Mahābhārata (iii.185, Bombay Edition) he expresses a sentiment very similar to that expressed in the stanza quoted above.  In mediaeval literature he is said to have been one of five or seven mind born sons of Brahma who remained pure and innocent.  A later and debased Jaina version of the legend tells in detail of the love adventures and wives of this knight, with a few words at the end on his conversion to the saintly life.

The mother, naming him Sānu, took him at the age of seven to the monks for ordination, thinking thus to ensure for him supreme happiness.  He was known as Sānu (Sānu Sāmanera) the Novice, and became a very learned teacher of the doctrine, practising the meditation of love (mettā), and was popular among gods and men.[/p][p]His mother in a previous birth was a Yakkha.  Later, Sānu lost his intellectual discernment and grew distraught and longed to go roaming.  His former Yakkha mother seeing this, warned his human mother as described in the Sānu Sutta (q.v.).  The latter was overwhelmed with grief, and, when Sānu visited her, he found her weeping.  She told him that he was as good as dead in that he had rejected the Buddha's teaching and turned again to lower things, hence her sorrow.  Sānu was filled with anguish, and, strengthening his insight, he soon won arahantship (ThagA.i.113f).[/p][p]He is evidently identical with Udakadāyaka of the Apadāna (Ap.i.205).  In the past, he saw Siddhattha Buddha having his meal and brought him water for his hands and feet and face and mouth.  Sixty one kappas ago he was a king, named Vimala.[/p][p]The story of Sānu is given also in the Samyutta and Dhammapada Commentaries (SA.i.235ff.; DhA.iv.18ff), but the details differ.  There, Sānu's human mother is portrayed as encouraging him to return to the lay life.  His Yakkha-mother went to his human mother's home, where Sānu was waiting for a meal, took possession of his body, twisted his neck, and felled him to the ground, where he lay foaming at the mouth.  Sānu's mother was filled with despair.  The Yakkhinī then revealed herself and exhorted Sānu not to behave foolishly by disregarding the Buddha's teaching.  When he regained his senses, his human mother, too, pointed out the disadvantages of household life.  When he declared his intention of not returning to lay life, she fed him with choice food and gave him a set of three robes that he might receive the upasampadā ordination.

When the Buddha was at the Ajapālanigrodha, hesitating as to whether or not he should preach the Dhamma, Sahampati appeared before him and begged of him to open to the world the doors of Immortality.  The Buddha agreed to this urgent request (Vin.i.5f.;S.i.137f), and accepted from Sahampati the assurance that all the Buddhas of the past had also had no other teacher than the Dhamma discovered by them.  S.i.139; see also S.v.167f.,185, 232, where he gives the same assurance to the Buddha regarding the four satipatthānas and the five indriyas; A.ii.10f.[/p][p]Buddhaghosa (E.g., SA.i.155) explains that the Buddha was reluctant to preach, not on account of indolence, but because he wished Sahampati to make him this request.  For, thought the Buddha, the world honours Brahmā greatly, and when people realized that Brahmā himself had begged of the Buddha to spread his teaching, they would pay more attention to it.  Sahampati was, at this time, the most senior of the Brahmās (jettha-Mahābrahmā) (DA.ii.467).[/p][p]Sahampati once saw that the brahminee, mother of Brahmadeva Thera, habitually made offerings to Brahmā.  Out of compassion for her, Sahampati appeared before her and exhorted her to give her offerings to Brahmadeva instead (S.i.140f).  On another occasion, when Kokāliya died and was born in Padumaniraya, Sahampati appeared before the Buddha and announced the fact to him (SN.  p.125; cp.  S.i.151; A.v.172).  The Samyutta (S.i.154f) contains a series of verses spoken by Sahampati at Andhakavinda, when the Buddha sat out in the open during the night and rain fell drop by drop.  The verses are in praise of the life and practices of the monks and of the results thereof.  Sahampati again visited the Buddha, simultaneously with Sakka, and as they stood leaning against a doorpost of the Buddha's cell, Sakka uttered a verse in praise of the Buddha.  Sahampati then added another verse, exhorting the Buddha to preach the Doctrine, as there were those who would understand (S.i.233).  A verse spoken by him immediately after the Buddha's death is included in the books (D.ii.157; S.i.158).[/p][p]During the time of Kassapa Buddha, Sahampati was a monk, named Sahaka, who, having practised the five indriyas (saddhā, etc.), was reborn in the Brahma world.  Thereafter he was called Sahampati (S.v.233).  The Commentaries say (SNA.ii.476; SA.i.155) that he was an Anāgāmī Brahmā born in the Suddhāvāsā, there to pass a whole kappa, because he had developed the first Jhāna as a monk.  The Buddhavamsa, Commentary (BuA.p.11; see also p.29) says that, strictly speaking, his name should be "Sahakapati." When the Buddha attained Enlightenment, Sahampati held over the Buddha's head a white parasol three yojanas in diameter.  BuA.239; this incident was sculptured in the Relic Chamber of the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxx.74); cp.  J.iv.266. [/p][p]Once he offered to the Buddha a chain of jewels (ratanadāma) as large as Sineru (KhA.171; Sp.i.115; Vsm.201).  On the day that Alindakavāsi Mahāphussadeva attained arahantship, Sahampati came to wait upon him (VibhA.352).[/p][p]It has been suggested (VT.i.86, n.1) that Brahmā Sahampati is very probably connected with Brahmi Svayambhū of brahmanical literature.[/p]</e>

When plague broke out in Bhaddavatī, she and her parents fled to Kosambī, and there obtained food from the alms hall provided by Ghosaka.  On the first day Sāmāvatī asked for three portions, on the second two, on the third only one.  For her father had died after the meal on the first day, her mother on the second.  When, on the third day, she asked for only one portion,  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/mitta,Mitta')"]Mitta[/a] who was distributing alms, teased her, saying: "Today you know the capacity of your belly." She asked what he meant, and when he explained his words, she told him what had happened.  Mitta pitied her and adopted her as his daughter.[/p][p]One day, when she arrived at the refectory, she found a great uproar going on, people rushing everywhere to get alms.  She asked to be allowed to bring order into this chaos, and had a fence erected round the refectory with separate doors for entrance and exit.  This put an end to the disturbances.  Ghosaka, hearing no noise in the refectory as before, inquired the reason, and, finding out what Sāmāvatī had done, adopted her as his own child.  Sāmāvatī's original name was Sāmā, but after building the fence (vati) round the refectory she was called Sāmāvatī.[/p][p]On a festival day Udena saw Sāmāvatī going to the river to bathe, and, falling in love with her, asked Ghosaka to send her to the palace.  But Ghosaka refused, and the king turned him and his wife out of doors and sealed up his house.  When Sāmāvatī discovered this, she made Ghosaka send her to the palace, and Udena made her his chief consort.  Some time afterwards Udena took  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maagandiyaa,Māgandiyā')"]Māgandiyā[/a] also as consort.[/p][p]When the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"]Buddha[/a] visited Kosambī at the request of [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/ghosaka_setthi,Ghosaka')"]Ghosaka[/a],  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kukkuta,Kukkuta')"]Kukkuta[/a] and Pāvāriya,  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/khujjuttaraa,Khujjutarā')"]Khujjutarā[/a], the servant woman of Sāmāvatī, heard him preach and became a  [a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/s_t/sotaapanna,Sotāpanna')"]Sotāpanna[/a].  She had been on her way to the gardener, Sumana, to buy flowers for Sāmāvatī, with the eight pieces of money given to her daily by the king for this purpose.  On Sumana's invitation, she had gone to hear the Buddha at his house.  On other days she had spent only half the money on flowers, appropriating the rest for herself; but this day, having become a Sotāpanna, she bought flowers with the whole amount and took them to Sāmāvatī, to whom she confessed her story.  At Sāmāvatī's request, Khujjuttarā repeated to her and her companions the sermon she had heard from the Buddha.  After this, she visited the Buddha daily, repeating his sermon to Sāmāvatī and her friends.  Having learnt that the Buddha passed along the street in which the palace stood, Sāmāvatī had holes made in the walls so that she and her friends might see the Buddha and do obeisance to him.  Māgandiyā heard of this during a visit to Sāmāvatī's quarters, and, because of her hatred for the Buddha, she determined to have Sāmāvatī punished.  For details see  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maagandiyaa,Māgandiyā')"]Māgandiyā[/a].[/p][p]At first her plots miscarried, and Udena, convinced of Sāmāvatī's goodness, gave her a boon, and she chose that the Buddha be invited to visit the palace daily and to preach to her and her friends.  But the Buddha sent  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda,Ananda')"]Ananda[/a] instead, and they provided him with food every day and listened to the Law.  One day they presented him with five hundred robes given to them by the king, who, at first, was very angry; but on hearing from Ananda that nothing given to the monks was lost, he gave another five hundred robes himself.[/p][p]In the end, Māgandiyā's plot succeeded, and Sāmāvatī and her companions were burned to death in their own house.  Udena was in his park, and, on his arrival, he found them all dead.  When the Buddha was asked, he said that sonic of the women had attained to the First Fruit of the Path, others to the second, yet others to the third.  It is said that in a previous birth Sāmāvatī and her friends had belonged to the harem of the king of Benares.  One day they went bathing with the king, and, feeling cold when they came out of the water, they set fire to a tangle of grass, near by.  When the grass burned down, they found a Pacceka Buddha seated in the tangle, and fearing that they had burnt him to death, they pulled more grass, which they placed round his body, and, after pouring oil on it, set fire to it so that all traces of their crime might be destroyed.  The Pacceka Buddha was in samādhi and nothing could therefore harm him, but it was this act which brought retribution to Sāmāvatī and her companions.  [/p][p]The story of Sāmāvatī is included in the story cycle of Udena.  For details see especially DhA.i.187 91, 205 225; the story also appears, with certain variations in detail, in AA.i.232 4, 236ff., and is given very briefly in UdA.382f., omitting the account of the reason for Sāmāvatī's death which is given at length in an explanation of an  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udaana,Udāna')"]Udāna[/a] (Ud.vii.10) dealing with the incident.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Sankhapāla Jātaka (No.  521)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta born as Duyyodhana, son of the king of Rājagaha.  When he came of age his father handed over the kingdom to him, became an ascetic, and lived in the royal park.  There Duyyodhana frequently visited him; finding this inconvenient, the ascetic went to Mahimsakarattha and lived in a hut on a bend of the Kannapennā River, which flows from the Sankhapāla Lake near Mount Candaka.  There he was visited by the Nāga king Sankhapāla, to whom he preached the Dhamma.  Later, Duyyodhana discovered the whereabouts of the ascetic and visited him.  There he saw the Nāga-king, and, impressed by his great magnificence, desired to visit the Nāga-world.  On his return to the capital, Duyyodhana engaged in works of merit, and was born after death in the Nāga world and became its king under the name of Sankhapāla.  In course of time, he grew weary of his magnificence, and, leaving the Nāga world, lived near the Kannapennā, on an ant hill, keeping the holy fast.  As he lay there, sixteen men, roaming in the forest, saw him and seized him.  They drove stakes into his body, and made holes in the stakes and fastened ropes to them in order to drag him along.  But Sankhapāla showed no resentment.  A landowner of Mithilā, called Alāra, saw him being ill treated and had him released.  Thereupon, Sankhapāla invited Alāra to the Nāga world, and Alāra lived there for one year.  He later became an ascetic, and, in due course, visited Benares, where he told the king the story of his visit to the Nāga world.  After the rains he returned to the Himālaya.[/p][p]The story was told to some laymen who kept the fast.[/p][p]The Bodhisatta's father is identified with Mahā Kassapa, the king of Benares with Ananda, and Alāra with Sāriputta.

One day he retired to a lonely place and was reciting the spell.  A jackal, hiding in a hole near by, overheard it and learned it by heart.  When the Bodhisatta had finished his recital, the jackal appeared before him, and saying: "Ho, brahmin, I have learnt your spell," ran away.  The Bodhisatta chased him, but in vain.  As a result of learning the spell, the jackal subdued all the creatures of the forest and became their king, under the name of Sabbadātha.  On the back of two elephants stood a lion and on the lion's back sat Sabbadātha, with his consort.[/p][p]Filled with pride, the jackal wished to capture Benares, and went with his army and besieged the city.  The king was alarmed, but the Bodhisatta reassured him, and, having learnt from Sabbadātha that he proposed to capture the city by making the lions roar, gave orders to the inhabitants to stop their ears with flour.  Then he mounted the watch tower and challenged Sabbadātha to carry out his threat.  This Sabbadātha did, and even the lions on which he rode joined in the roar.  The elephants were so terrified that, in their fright, they dropped Babbadātha, who was trampled to death.  The carcases of the animals which died in the tumult covered twelve leagues.[/p][p]The story was related in reference to Devadatta's attempts to injure the Buddha, which only resulted in working harm upon himself.[/p][p]The jackal is identified with Devadatta and the king with Ananda (J.ii.242 6).[/p][p]The story is referred to in the Milinda-Pañha (Mil.  P.  202), and there the Bodhisatta's name is given as Vidhura.  [/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Sattigumba Jātaka (No.  503)[/div][p]Two parrots were once carried away by the wind during the moulting season.  One of them fell among the weapons in a robber village and was called Sattigumba; the other fell in a hermitage among flowers and was called Pupphaka.  He was the Bodhisatta.  One day, Pañcāla, king of Uttarapañcāla, went out hunting.  While chasing the deer with his charioteer, he was separated from his bodyguard and found himself in a glen near the robbers' village.  There he slept.  The robbers were absent, leaving only Sattigumba and a cook, named Patikolamba.  The parrot, seeing the king, plotted with the cook to kill him.  The king overheard the plan and fled with his charioteer.  In his flight he came to the hermitage, where he was made welcome by Pupphaka till the return of the sages.  The king told his story, and Pupphaka explained that though he and Sattigumba were brothers, heir upbringing had been different, which accounted for the difference in their natures.  The king decreed immunity to all parrots and provided for the comfort of sages in his park.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to Devadatta's attempt to kill the Buddha by hurling a stone at him.  Sattigamba is identified with Devadatta and the king with Ananda.  J.iv.430 7.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Sarabhanga Jātaka (No.  522)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta was once born as the son of the purohita of the king of Benares.  He was called Jotipāla because, on the day of his birth, there was a blaze of all kinds of arms for a distance of twelve leagues round Benares.  This showed that he would be the chief archer of all India.[/p][p]After having been educated in Takkasilā, he returned to Benares and entered the king's service, receiving one thousand a day.  When the king's attendants grumbled at this, the king ordered Jotipāla to give an exhibition of his skill.  This he did, in the presence of sixty thousand archers.  With the bow and arrow he performed twelve unrivalled acts of skill and cleft seven hard substances.  Then he drove an arrow through a furlong of water and two furlongs of earth and pierced a hair at a distance of half a furlong.  The sun set at the conclusion of this exhibition, and the king promised to appoint him commander in chief the next day.  But during the night, Jotipāla felt a revulsion for the household life, and, departing unannounced, went into the Kapittha vana on the Godhāvarī and there became an ascetic.  On Sakka's orders, Vissakamma built a hermitage for him, in which he lived, developing great iddhi powers.  When his parents and the king with his retinue visited him, he converted them to the ascetic life, and his followers soon numbered many thousands.[/p][p]He had seven pupils Sālissara, Mendissara, Pabbata, Kāladevala, Kisavaccha, Anusissa and Nārada.  When Kapitthavana became too crowded, Jotipāla, now known as Sarabhanga, sent his pupils away to different parts of the country: Sālissara to Lambacūlaka, Mendissara to Sātodikā, Pabbata to Añjana Mountain, Kāladevala to Ghanasela, Kisavaccha to Kumbhavatī and Nārada to Arañjara, while Anusissa remained with him.  When Kisavaccha, through the folly of a courtesan, was ill treated by King Dandakī of Kumbhavatī and his army, Sarabhanga heard from the king's commander in chief of this outrage and sent two of his pupils to bring Kisavaccha on a palanquin to the hermitage.  There he died, and when his funeral was celebrated, for the space of half a league round his pyre there fell a shower of celestial flowers.[/p][p]Because of the outrage committed on Kisavaccha, sixty leagues of Dandakī's kingdom were destroyed together with the king.  When the news of this spread abroad, three kings Kalinga, Atthaka and Bhimaratha recalling stories of other similar punishments that had followed insults to holy men, went to visit Sarabhanga in order to get at the truth of the matter.  They met on the banks of the Godhāvarī, and there they were joined by Sakka.  Sarabhanga sent Anusissa to greet them and offer them hospitality, and, when they had rested, gave them permission to put their questions.  Sarabhanga explained to them how Dandaka, Nālikira, Ajjuna and Kalābu, were all born in hell owing to their ill-treatment of holy men, and went to expound to them the moral law.  Even as he spoke the three kings were filled with the desire for renunciation, and at the end of Sarabhanga's discourse they became ascetics, under him.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to the death of Moggallāna (q.v.).  It is said that after Moggallāna had been attacked by brigands and left by them for dead, he recovered consciousness, and, flying to the Buddha, obtained his consent to die.  The six deva worlds were filled with great commotion, and, after his death, the devas brought offerings of flowers and incense to his pyre, which was made of sandalwood and ninety nine precious things.  When the body was placed on the pyre flowers rained down for the space of one league round and for seven days there was a great festival.  The Buddha had the relics collected and deposited in a shrine in Veluvana.  The Buddha identified Moggallāna, with Kisavaccha and related this Jātaka.  Of the others, Sālissara was Sāriputta, Mendissara Kassapa, Pabbata Anuruddha, Devala Kaccāyana, and Anusissa Ananda.  J.v.125 51.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Sānu Sutta[/div][p]Contains the conversation between Sānu's mother and the Yakkhinī, who possessed Sānu (see Sānu) in order to prevent him from "losing his soul." Sānu's mother says she cannot understand how Yakkhas can possess holy men who keep the fasts and lead holy lives.  The Yakkhinī says she is right; but holiness consists in refraining from evil, both open and secret.  Sānu's mother understands, and, when her son regains consciousness and asks her why she weeps as he is not dead, she replies that he is as good as dead in that he wishes to return to the household life, like goods, which having been rescued from the fire, wish to be thrown into it once more.  S.i.208f.[/p]</e>
