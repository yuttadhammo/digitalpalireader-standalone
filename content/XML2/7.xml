  <e>[div class="huge"]Gaggarā (Sutta)[/div][hr][p][b]1. Gaggarā.[/b]-A lotus-pond at Campā.  [/p][p][/p][p]The Buddha is several times mentioned as staying on the banks of the pond.  On one such occasion Pessa and Kandaraka visited him, and he preached to them the Kandaraka Sutta (M.i.339).  Among others who visited him there are mentioned Bāhuna (A.v.151), Vajjiyamāhita (A.v.189), and Kassapagotta (Vin.i.312).  On one occasion, when the Buddha was staying there, Sāriputta approached him with a large number of the inhabitants of Campā and asked him questions concerning the efficacy of giving alms (A.iv.59ff).[/p][p][/p][p]On another such occasion Sāriputta assembled the monks and preached to them the Dasuttara Sutta (D.iii.272ff).  It was on the banks of the Gaggarā that the Buddha preached the Karandava Sutta (q.v.) on the necessity of getting rid of evil-minded members of the Sangha lest they should corrupt the whole Order (A.iv.168f), and the pond-bank was also the scene of the preaching of the well-known Sonadanda Sutta (D.i.111f).  Once, when the Buddha was at this spot with a large number of monks and lay-followers, Vangīsa came up to him and praised him in a song, pointing out how the Buddha outshone them all (S.i.195; Thag.v.1252; ThagA.ii.210).[/p][p][/p][p]The pond was called Gaggarā because it owed its origin to a queen of that name.  On its bank was a Campaka-grove where the Buddha stayed during his visits (MA.ii.565; DA.i.279f).  Nearby was a monastery of titthiyas.  (See A.v.189).  The pond, together with that at Jetavana, is given as an example of a very beautiful lotus pond (E g., AA.i.264).  Monks found it a convenient spot for meditation (SNA.i.17).[/p][p][/p][hr][p][b]2.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Gandhabbā[/div][p]A class of semi-divine beings who inhabit the Cātumma-hārājika-realm and are the lowest among the devas (D.ii.212).  They are generally classed together with the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asura,Asuras')"]Asuras[/a] and the Nāgas (E.g., A.iv.200, 204, 207).  Beings are born among them as a result of having practised the lowest form of sīla (D.ii.212, 271).[/p][p]It is a disgrace for a monk to be born in the Gandhabba-world (D.ii.221, 251, 273f).  The Gandhabbas are regarded as the heavenly musicians, and  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pancasikha,Pañcasikha')"]Pañcasikha[/a],  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suriyavaccasaa,Suriyavaccasā')"]Suriyavaccasā[/a] and her father  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/timbaru,Timbarū')"]Timbarū[/a] are among their number (D.ii.264).  [/p][p]They wait on such devas as Sakka, and the males among them form the masculine counterpart of the accharā, the nymphs.  Their king is  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhatarattha,Dhatarattha')"]Dhatarattha[/a], ruler of the eastern quarter (D.ii.257).  Other chieftains are also mentioned (D.ii.258): Panāda, Opamañña, Sakka's charioteer Mātalī, Cittasena, Nala and Janesabha.  [/p][p]The Gandhabbas are sometimes described as vihangamā (going through the air) (A.ii.39; AA.ii.506).  In the Ātānātiya Sutta (D.iii.203, 204) the Gandhabbas are mentioned among those likely to trouble monks and nuns in their meditations in solitude.  The Buddha says that beings are born among the Gandhabakāyikā devā because they wish to be so; they are described as dwelling in the fragrance of root-wood, of bark and sap, and in that of flowers and scents (S.iii.250f).[/p][p]It is often stated that the Gandhabbas preside over conception; this is due to an erroneous translation of the word gandhabba in passages (E.g., M.i.157, 265f) dealing with the circumstances necessary for conception (mātāpitaro ca sannipatitā honti, mātā ca utunī hoti, gandhabbo ca paccupatthito hoti).  [/p][p]The Commentaries (E.g., MA.i.481f ) explain that here gandhabba means tatrūpakasatta - tasmim okāse nibbattanako satto - meaning a being fit and ready to be born to the parents concerned.  The Tīkā says that the word stands for gantabba.  See also Gandhabbarājā.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Girimānanda Thera[/div][p]He was the son of King Bimbisāra's chaplain and, having seen the might of the Buddha when the Buddha entered Rājagaha, joined the Order.  He lived in a village studying, but one day, when he came to Rājagaha to visit the Buddha, the king asked him to remain, promising to look after him.  The king, however, forgot his promise, and Girimānanda had to live in the open.  The gods, fearing to wet him, stopped rain from falling.  The king, observing the drought and discovering the reason for it, built him a hermitage wherein the Thera put forth effort and became an arahant.[/p][p]In the time of Sumedha Buddha he was a householder, and when his wife and children died he fled into the forest in grief.  There the Buddha consoled him, and he offered flowers to the Buddha and sang his praises (Thag.vv.325-9; ThagA.i.409ff; Ap.i.330f).[/p][p]The Giri Sutta was preached in reference to Girimānanda, when he lay grievously ill.

But various mishaps befell Gāmani-Canda, and he was charged on various counts by different people.  As he was being brought to the king to receive punishment, he was asked by several persons to convey messages to the king, and to find out from him solutions for their troubles.  [/p][p]The king listened to the charges brought against Gāmani and to his explanation of them.  Convinced of Gāmani's innocence, he passed sentences which ultimately brought gain to Gāmani.  The king then proceeded to solve the problems contained in the messages brought by Gāmani.  He gave to Gāmani the village in which he lived, free from all taxes, and there Gāmani lived happily to the end of his days.[/p][p]The story was told by the Buddha to certain monks who had been discussing his wisdom.[/p][p]Gāmani-Canda is identified with Ananda.

(Vin.i.18f.; Thag.v.38; ThagA.i.103f; VvA.331f; DA.iii.814 gives a slightly different version of the origin of the Serissaka-vimāna).[/p][p]Gavampati was the teacher of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahanaga,Mahānāga')"]Mahānāga[/a], son of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/m1_mag,Madhu-Vāsettha')"]Madhu-Vāsettha[/a] (ThagA.i.443).  It is said that the Serissaka-vimāna, occupied by Gavampati, remained in the Cātummahārajika world even after he had left it.  (D.ii.356f; DA.iii.814 says he went there because he found the "climate" (utu) more agreeable.

Gavampati.-[/b] The Sāsanavamsa (p.36f) speaks of a Thera by this name, at whose request the Buddha went to Sudhammapura in the Rāmañña country to establish his religion.  In a previous life Gavampati was born of an egg laid by a Nāga maiden who had relations with a vijjā-dhara.  The egg was hatched and a child was born, but it died at the age of ten and was reborn at Mithilā as Gavampati.  He joined the Order at the age of seven and became an arahant.  Later he visited Sudhamma-pura to preach to his mother, and there King Sīha asked him to invite the Buddha to his country.[/p][hr][p][b]Gavampati Sutta.[/b]-Preached by Gavampati at Sahajāti in the Ceti country.  A number of the senior monks were talking of dukkha, and Gavampati tells them that he knows from the Buddha's own self that whosoever understands dukkha knows all its aspects - its nature, its arising, its cessation and the path thereto.

The Bodhisatta, not knowing this, went to work as usual on the fast day, but, on discovering that no one else was working and the reason for their abstention, he refused to take any food, and as a result of his fasting died in the night.  He was reborn as son of the king of Benares, and later became king under the name of Udaya.  On meeting Addhamāsaka (q.v.), Udaya shared the kingdom with him, but one day Addhamāsaka, discovering that he harboured a desire to kill Udaya, renounced his kingdom and became an ascetic.  When Udaya heard of this he uttered a stanza, referring to his own past life, but no one could understand the meaning of it.  The queen, anxious to learn the meaning, told the king's barber Gangamāla how he might win the king's favour, and when the king offered him a boon, Gangamāla chose to have the stanza explained to him.  When he learnt how Udaya had won a kingdom as a result of having kept the fast for half a day, Gangamāla renounced the world and, developing asceticism, became a Pacceka Buddha.  Later he visited King Udaya and preached to him and his retinue, addressing the king by name.  The queen-mother took offence at this and abused Gangamāla, but the king begged him to forgive her.  Gangamāla returned to Gandhamādana, though urged by Udaya to stay in the royal park.[/p][p]Ananda was Addhamāsaka, and Rāhulamātā was the queen.[/p][p]The story was related by the Buddha to some lay-followers to en-courage them in their observance of the Uposatha (J.iii.444ff).

It is said that she recovered her hair immediately on seeing Mahā Kaccāna.  When the Elder reached Ujjeni that very day, by air, he related the incident to King Udena and the king, having sent messengers to fetch Gopālamātā, made her his chief consort.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Garudā, Garulā[/div][p]A class of mythical birds generally mentioned in company with  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/naaga,Nāgas')"]Nāgas[/a] (E.g., J.iv.181, 202).  [/p][p]They live in Simbali-groves (E.g., J.i.202) and are usually huge in size, sometimes one hundred and fifty leagues from wing to wing (J.iii.397).  The flapping of their wings can raise a storm, known as the Garuda-wind (J.v.77).  This wind can plunge a whole city in darkness and cause houses to fall through its violence (J.iii.188).  [/p][p]A Garula has strength great enough to carry off a whole banyan tree, tearing it up from its roots (J.vi.177).  The Garulas are the eternal enemies of the Nāgas (J.ii.13; iii.103) and live in places, such as the Seruma Island (J.iii.187), where Nāgas are to be found.  The greatest happiness of the Nāgas is to be free from the attacks of the Garulas (J.iv.463).  A Garula's plumage is so thick that a man - e.g.,  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/n2_ny,Natakuvera')"]Natakuvera[/a] (J.iii.91) - could hide in it, unnoticed by the bird.  Sometimes Garulas assume human form; two Garula kings are said to have played dice with kings of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"]Benares[/a] and to have fallen in love with their queens, whom they took to the Garula city - one of the queens being  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sussondii_jat_360,Sussondī')"]Sussondī[/a] (J.iii.187) and the other  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaakaatii_jat_327,Kākātī')"]Kākātī[/a] (J.iii.91).  In each case the queen, being found unfaithful to her Garula lover, was returned to her husband.  The Garulas know the Ālambāyana spell, which no Nāga can resist (J.vi.178, 184).  It is said that in olden days the Garulas did not know how to seize Nāgas effectively; they caught them by the bead, and the Nāgas who had swallowed big stones were too heavy to be lifted from the ground; consequently the Garulas died of exhaustion in trying to carry them.  Later the Garulas learnt this secret through the treachery of the ascetic  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/karambiya,Karambiya')"]Karambiya[/a], as related in the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pandara_jat_518,Pandara Jātaka')"]Pandara Jātaka[/a] (J.vi.175f).  [/p][p]Garulas are mentioned as sometimes leading virtuous lives, keeping the fast and observing the precepts.  One such was the Garula king mentioned in the Pandara Jātaka, and another, the son of Vināta, who visited the park of Dhanañjaya Koravya and gave a golden garland as present after hearing Vidhurapandita preach (J.vi.261f).

  <e>[div class="huge"]Guna Jātaka (No.157)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta was once a Lion, and one day while out hunting he sank into a bog and remained there starving for seven days until rescued by a Jackal.  To show his gratitude the Lion took the Jackal and his wife home with him, and the two animals and their wives lived together, the Lion and the Jackal going out together hunting.  Later on, the Lioness grew jealous of the she-Jackal and tried to frighten her away in the absence of their husbands.  When the Lion heard of this, he told his wife how the Jackal had befriended him in his hour of danger, and thenceforth they all lived happily together.[/p][p]The Jackal is identified with Ananda.[/p][p][/p][p]The story was told in reference to a gift made by Ananda.  Once, when he had been preaching to the women of Pasenadi's palace, they gave him five hundred new garments which the king had just presented to them.  The king hearing of this was at first annoyed, but on questioning Ananda he was satisfied that no gift presented to the Sangha could ever be wasted.  Delighted with this discovery, the king himself gave five hundred robes to Ananda, all of which Ananda presented to a young monk who was very useful and helpful to him.  The monk, in his turn, distributed them among his fellow celibates, who wondered why Ananda should have singled out one monk as the recipient of his gifts.  When the matter was related to the Buddha, he assured the monks that the gift was offered to the monk by Ananda only in return for numerous services (J.ii.23ff).[/p][p]The Jātaka is also called Sīha Jātaka, and probably also the Sigāla Jātaka.

The Buddha then tells the monk of the great luxuries he had enjoyed as king (Mahā-Sudassana) of Kusāvati, and of how they all perished (S.iii.143f).[/p][p][/p][p]This sutta was preached by Mahinda at the Nandana grove, on the sixth day after his arrival in Ceylon.

This journey is called Gangārohana.[/p][p][/p][p]The Sutta mentioned is probably, therefore, the Ratana Sutta (q.v.) which the Buddha preached at Vesāli.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Gotama[/div][p]The last of the twenty-five Buddhas.[/p][p]No comprehensive account of Gotama Buddha is as yet possible.  The details given in this article are those generally accepted by orthodox Theravādins and contained in their books, chiefly the Pāli Commentaries, more especially the Nidānakathā of the Jātaka and the Buddhavamsa Commentary.  [/p][p][/p][p]Biographical details are also found in the Mahā Vagga and the Culla Vagga of the Vinaya Pitaka, the Buddhavamsa and in various scattered passages of the Nikayas of the Sutta Pitaka.  References to these are given where considered useful.  Controversy exists with regard to many of the matters mentioned; for discussion of the varying views regarding these, reference should be made to the works of Oldenberg, Rhys Davids (both Professor and Mrs.  Rhys Davids), Kern, E.  J.  Thomas and other scholars.  Further particulars of persons and places mentioned can be obtained by reference to the articles under the respective names.[/p][p][/p][p]He was a Sākiyan (the Sākiyans were evidently subjects of the Kosala king; the Buddha calls himself a Kosalan, M.ii.124), son of Suddhodana (all Pāli Commentaries and Sanskrit works represent the Buddha as the son of a king, descendant of a long line of famous ancestors), chief ruler of Kapilavatthu, and of Mahā Māyā, Suddhodana's chief consort, and he belonged to the Gotama-gotta.  Before his conception he was in the Tusita heaven, waiting for the due time for his birth in his last existence.  Then, having made the "five investigations" (pañcavilolcanāni) (see Buddha), he took leave of his companions and descended to earth.  (According to the Lalitavistara he appointed the Bodhisatta Maitreya as king of Tusita in his place).  Many wondrous and marvellous events attended his conception and birth.  (Given in the Acchariyabbhutadhamma Sutta, M.iii.118f; also D.ii.12f.  A more detailed account is found in J.i.47ff; both the Lai.  and the Mtu.ii.14ff differ as to the details given here of the conception and the birth).  [/p][p][/p][p]The conception takes place on the full-moon day of Āsālha, with the moon in Uttarāsālha, and Maya has no relations with her husband.  She has a marvellous dream in which the Bodhisatta, as a white elephant, enters her womb through her side.  When the dream is mentioned to the brahmins, they foretell the birth of a son who will be either a universal monarch or a Buddha.  An earthquake takes place and thirty-two signs appear, presaging the birth of a great being.  The first of these signs is a boundless, great light, flooding every corner of the ten thousand worlds; everyone beholds its glory, even the fires in all hells being extinguished.  Ten months after the conception, in the month of Visākha, Māyā wishes to visit her parents in Devadaha.  On the way thither from Kapilavatthu she passes the beautiful Lumbini grove, in which she desires to wander; she goes to a great sāla-tree and seizes a branch in her hand; labour pains start immediately, and, when the courtiers retire, having drawn a curtain round her, even while standing, she is delivered of the child.  It is the day of the full moon of Visākha; four Mahābrahmas receive the babe in a golden net, and streams of water descend from the sky to wash him.  The boy stands on the earth, takes seven steps north-wards and utters his lion-roar, "I am the chief in the world." On the same day seven other beings were born: the Bodhi-tree, Rāhula's mother (Rāhulamātā, his future wife), the four Treasure-Troves (described at DA.i.284), his elephant, his horse Kanthaka, his charioteer Channa, and Kāludāyī.  The babe is escorted back to Kapilavatthu on the day of his birth and his mother dies seven days later.[/p][p][/p][p]The isi Asita (or Kāladevala), meditating in the Himālaya, learns from the Tāvatimsa gods of the birth of the Buddha, visits Suddhodana the same day and sees the boy, whom they both worship.  Asita weeps for sorrow that he will not live to see the boy's Buddhahood, but he instructs his nephew Nālaka (v.l.  Naradatta) to prepare himself for that great day.  On the fifth day after the birth is the ceremony of name-giving.  One hundred and eight brahmins are invited to the festival at the palace; eight of them - Rāma, Dhaja, Lakkhana, Manti, Kondañña, Bhoja, Suyāma and Sudatta - are interpreters of bodily marks, and all except Kondañña prophesy two possibilities for the boy; but Kondañña, the youngest, says, quite decisively, that he will be a Buddha.  The name given to the boy at this ceremony is not actually mentioned, but from other passages it is inferred that it was Siddhattha (q.v.).[/p][p][/p][p]Among other incidents recounted of the Buddha's boyhood is that of his attaining the first jhāna under a jambu-tree.  One day he is taken to the state ploughing of the king where Suddhodana himself, with his golden plough, ploughs with the farmers.  The nurses, attracted by the festivities, leave the child under a jambu-tree.  They return to find him seated, cross-legged, in a trance, the shadow of the tree remaining still, in order to protect him.  The king is informed and, for the second time, does reverence to his son.  J.i.57f; MA.i.466f; the incident is alluded to in the Mahā Saccaka Sutta (M.i.246); the corresponding incident recounted in Mtu.  (ii.45f.) takes place in a park, and the, details differ completely.  The Lai.  has two versions, one in prose and one in verse and both resemble the Mtu.; but in these the Buddha is represented as being much older.  The Divy (391) and the Tibetan versions (e.g., Rockhill, p.22) put the incident very much later in the Buddha's life.  Other incidents are given in Lai.  and Mtu.[/p][p][/p][p]The Bodhisatta is reported to have lived in the household for twenty-nine years a life of great luxury and excessive ease, surrounded by all imaginable comforts.  He owns three palaces - Ramma, Suramma and Subha - for the three seasons.  Mention is made of his luxurious life in A.i.145; also in M.i.504; further details are given in AA.i.378f.; J.i.58. See also Mtu.ii.115; cf.  Vin.i.15; D.ii.21.[/p][p][/p][p]When the Bodhisatta is sixteen years old, Suddhodana sends messengers to the Sākyans asking that his son be allowed to seek a wife from among their daughters; but the Sākyans are reluctant to send them, for, they say, though the young man is hand-some, he knows no art; how, then, can he support a wife? When this is reported to the prince, he summons an assembly of the Sākyans and performs various feats, chief of these being twelve feats with a bow which needs the strength of one thousand men.  (The feats with the bow are described in the Sarabhanga Jātaka, J.v.129f ).  The Sākyans are so impressed that each sends him a daughter, the total number so sent being forty thousand.  The Bodhisatta appoints as his chief wife the daughter of Suppabuddha, who, later, comes to be called Rāhulamātā.  She is known under various names: Bhaddakaccā (or Kaccānā), Yasodharā.  Bimbā, Bimbasundarī and Gopā.  For a discussion see Rāhulamātā.[/p][p][/p][p]According to the generally accepted account, Gotama is twenty-nine when the incidents occur which lead to final renunciation.  Following the prophecy of the eight brahmins, his father had taken every precaution that his son should see no sign of old age, sickness or death.  But the gods decide that the time is come for the Enlightenment, and instil into Gotama's heart a desire to go into the park.  On the way, the gods put before him a man showing signs of extreme age, and the Bodhisatta returns, filled with desire for renunciation.  The king, learning this, surrounds him with even greater attractions, but on two other days Gotama goes to the park and the gods put before him a sick man and a corpse.  (According to some accounts, e.g.  that of the Dīghabhānakas, the four omens were all seen on the same day, J.i.59)[/p][p][/p][p]On the full-moon day of Āsālha, the day appointed for the Great Renunciation, Gotama sees a monk and hears from his charioteer praise of the ascetic life.  Feeling very happy, he goes to the park to enjoy himself.  Sakka sends Vissakamma himself to bathe and adorn him, and as Gotama returns to the city in all his majesty, he receives news of the birth of his son.  Foreseeing in this news a bond, he decides to call the babe Rāhula (q.v.).  Kisā Gotamī (q.v.) sees Gotama on the way to the palace and, filled with longing for him, sings to him a song containing the word nibbuta.  The significance of the word (=extinguished, at peace) thrills him, and he sends to Kisā his priceless gold necklace which she, however, accepts as a token of love.  Gotama enters the palace and sleeps.  He wakes in the middle of the night to find his female musicians sleeping in attitudes which fill him with disgust and with loathing for the worldly life, and he decides to leave it.  (In some versions the Renunciation takes place seven days after the birth of Rāhula, J.i.62).  He orders Channa to saddle Kanthaka, and enters his wife's room for a last look at her and their son.[/p][p][/p][p]He leaves the city on his horse Kanthaka, with Channa clinging to its tail.  The devas muffle the sound of the horse's hoofs and of his neighing and open the city gates for Gotama to pass.  Māra appears before Gotama and seeks to stay him with a promise that he shall be universal monarch within seven days.  On his offer being refused, Māra threatens to shadow him always.  Outside the city, at the spot where later was erected the Kanthakanivattana-cetiya, Gotama turns his horse round to take a last look at Kapilavatthu.  It is said that the earth actually turned, to make it easy for him to do so.  Then, accompanied by the gods, he rides thirty leagues through three kingdoms - those of the Sākyans, the Koliyans and the Mallas - and his horse crosses the river Anomā in one leap.  On the other side, he gives all his ornaments to Channa, and with his sword cuts off hair and beard, throwing them up into the air, where Sakka takes them and enshrines them in the Cūlāmani-cetiya in Tāvatimsa.  The Brahmā Ghatikāra offers Gotama the eight requisites of a monk, which he accepts and adopts.  He then sends Channa and Kanthaka back to his father, but Kanthaka, broken-hearted, dies on the spot and is reborn as Kanthaka-devaputta.  [/p][p][/p][p]The account given here is taken mainly from the Nidānakathā (J.i.59ff) and evidently embodies later tradition; cp.  D.ii.21ff.  From passages found in the Pitakas (e.g., A.i.145; M.i.163, 240; M.ii.212f.) it would appear that the events leading up to the Renunciation were not so dramatic as given here, the process being more gradual.  I do not, however, agree with Thomas (op.  cit., 58) that, according to these accounts, the Bodhisatta left the world when "quite a boy." I think the word dahara is used merely to indicate "the prime of youth," and not necessarily "boyhood." The description of the Renunciation in the Lal.  is very much more elaborate and adds numerous incidents, no account of which is found in the Pāli.[/p][p][/p][p]From Anomā the Bodhisatta goes to the mango-grove of Anupiya, and after spending seven days there walks to Rājagaha (a distance of thirty leagues) in one day, and there starts his alms rounds.  Bimbisāra's men, noticing him, report the matter to the king, who sends messengers to enquire who this ascetic is.  The men follow Gotama to the foot of the Pandavapabbata, where he eats his meal, and they then go and report to the king.  Bimbisāra visits Gotama, and, pleased with his hearing, offers him the sovereignty.  On learning the nature of Gotama's quest, he wins from him a promise to visit Rājagaha first after the Enlightenment.[/p][p][/p][p]This incident is also mentioned in the Pabbajjā Sutta (SN.vv.405-24), but there it is the king who first sees Gotama.  It is significant that, when asked his identity, Gotama does not say he is a king's son.  The Pali version of tile sutta contains nothing of Gotama's promise to visit Rājagaha, but the Mtu.  version (ii.198-200), which places the visit later, has two verses, one of which contains the request and the other the acceptance; and the SNA.  (ii.385f.), too, mentions the promise and tells that Bimbisāra was informed of the prophecy concerning Gotama.  There is another version of the Mtu.  (ii.117-20) which says that Gotama went straight to Vaisāli after leaving home, joining Ālāra, and later visited Uddaka at Rājagaha.  Here no mention is made of Bimbisāra.  We are told in the Mhv.  (ii.25ff) that Bimbisāra and Gotama (Siddhattha) had been playmates, Bimbisāra being the younger by five years.  Bimbisāra's father (Bhātī) and Suddhodana were friends.[/p][p][/p][p]Journeying from Rājagaha, Gotama in due course becomes a disciple of Ālāra-Kālāma.  Having learnt and practised all that Ālāra has to teach, he finds it unsatisfying and joins Uddaka-Rāmaputta; but Uddaka's doctrine leaves him still unconvinced and he abandons it.  He then goes to Senānīgāma in Uruvelā and there, during six years, practises all manner of severe austerities, such as no man had previously undertaken.  Once he falls fainting and a deva informs Suddhodana that Gotama is dead.  But Suddhodana, relying on the prophecy of Kāladevala, refuses to believe the news.  Gotama's mother, now born as a devaputta in Tāvatimsa, comes to him to encourage him.  At Uruvelā, the Pañcavaggiya monks are his companions, but now, having realised the folly of extreme asceticism, he decides to abandon it, and starts again to take normal food; thereupon the Pañcavaggiyas, disappointed, leave him and go to Isipatana.[/p][blockquote][p]J.i.66f.  The Therīgāthā Commentary (p.2) mentions another teacher of Gotama, named Bhaggava, whom Gotama visited before Ālāra.  Lal.  (330 [264]) contains a very elaborate account of Gotama's visits to teachers; he goes first to two brahmin women, Sākī and Padmā, then to Raivata and Rajaka, son of Trimandika, and finally (as far as this chapter is concerned) to Ālāra at Vaisāli.  A poem containing an account of the meeting of Gotama with Bimbisāra is inserted into this account.  The next chapter tells of Uddaka.  An account of Gotama's visits to teachers and of the details of his austerities is also given in the Mahā Saccaka Sutta, already referred to (M.i.240ff); the Mahā Sīhanāda Sutta (M.i.77ff) contains a long and detailed account of his extreme asceticisms.  See also M.i.163ff; ii.93f.[/p][/blockquote][p][/p][p]Gotama's desire for normal food is satisfied by an offering brought by Sujātā to the Ajapāla banyan tree under which he is seated.  She had made a vow to the tree, and her wish having been granted, she takes her slave-girl, Punnā, and goes to the tree prepared to fulfil her promise.  They take Gotama to be the Tree-god, come in person to accept her offering of milk-rice; the offering is made in a golden bowl and he takes it joyfully.  Five dreams he had the night before convince Gotama that he will that day become the Buddha.  (The dreams are, recounted in A.iii.240 and in Mtu.ii.136f).  It is the full-moon day of Visākha; he bathes at Suppatittha in the Nerañjarā, eats the food and launches the bowl up stream, where it sinks to the abode of the Nāga king, Kāla (Mahākāla).[/p][p][/p][p]Gotama spends the rest of the day in a sāla-grove and, in the evening, goes to the foot of the Bodhi-tree, accompanied by various divinities; there the grass-cutter Sotthiya gives him eight handfuls of grass; these, after investigation, Gotama spreads on the eastern side of the tree, where it becomes a seat fourteen hands long, on which he sits cross-legged, determined not to rise before attaining Enlightenment.[/p][p]J.i.69. The Pitakas know nothing of Sujātā's offering or of Sotthiya's gift.  Lal.  (334-7 [267-70]) mentions ten girls in all who provide him with food during his austerities.  Divy (392) mentions two, Nandā and Nandabalā.[/p][p][/p][p]Māra, lord of the world of passion, is determined to prevent this fulfilment, and attacks Gotama with all the strength at his command.  His army extends twelve leagues to the front, right, and left of him, to the end of the Cakkavāla behind him, and nine leagues into the sky above him.  Māra himself carries numerous weapons and rides the elephant Girimekhala, one hundred and fifty leagues in height.  At the sight of him all the divinities gathered at the Bodhi-tree to do honour to Gotama - the great Brahmā, Sakka, the Nāga-king Mahākāla - disappear in a flash, and Gotama is left alone with the ten pāramī, long practised by him, as his sole protection.  All Māra's attempts to frighten him by means of storms and terrifying apparitions fail, and, in the end, Māra hurls at him the Cakkāvudha.  It remains as a canopy poised over Gotama.  The very earth bears witness to Gotama's fitness to be the Enlightened One, and Girimekhala kneels before him.  Māra is vanquished and flees headlong with his vast army.  The various divinities who had fled at the approach of Māra now return to Gotama and exult in his triumph.[/p][p]The whole story of the contest with Māra is, obviously, a mythological development.  It is significant that in the Majjhima passages referred to earlier there is no mention of Māra, of a temptation, or even of a Bodhi-tree; but see D.ii.4 and Thomas (op.  cit., n.1).  According to the Kālingabodhi Jātaka, which, very probably, embodies an old tradition, the bodhi-tree was worshipped even in the Buddha's life-time.  The Māra legend is, however, to be found in the Canonical Padhāna Sutta of the Sutta Nipāta.  This perhaps contains the first suggestion of the legend.  For a discussion see Māra.[/p][p][/p][p]Gotama spends that night in deep meditation.  In the first watch he gains remembrance of his former existences; in the middle watch he attains the divine eye (dibbacakkhu); in the last watch he revolves in his mind the Chain of Causation (paticcasamuppāda).  As he masters this, the earth trembles and, with the dawn, comes Enlightenment.  He is now the supreme Buddha, and he breaks forth into a paean of joy (udāna).[/p][p]There is great doubt as to which were these Udāna verses.  The Nidānakathā and the Commentaries generally quote two verses (153, 154) included in the Dhammapada collection (anekajāti samsāram, etc.).  The Vinaya (i.2) quotes three different verses (as does also DhsA.17), and says that one verse was repeated at the end of each watch, all the watches being occupied with meditation on the paticcasamuppāda.  Mtu.  (ii.286) gives a completely different Udāna, and in another place (ii.416) mentions a different verse as the first Udāna.  The Tibetan Vinaya is, again, quite different (Rockhill, p.33).  For a discussion see Thomas, op.  cit., 75ff.[/p][p][/p][p]For the first week the Buddha remains under the Bodhi-tree, meditating on the Paticcasamuppāda; the second week he spends at the Ajapālanigrodha, where the "Huhuhka" Brahmin accosts him (Mara now comes again and asks the Buddha to die at once; D.ii.112) and where Mara's daughters, Tanhā, Aratī and Rāgā, appear before the Buddha and make a last attempt to shake his resolution (J.i.78; S.i.124; Lal.490 (378)); the third week he spends under the hood of the nāga-king Mucalinda (Vin.i.3); the fourth week is spent in meditation under the Rājāyatana tree*; at the end of this period takes place the conversion of Tapussa and Bhallika.  They take refuge in the Buddha and the Dhamma, though the Buddha does not give them any instruction.[/p][blockquote][p]*This is the Vinaya account (Vin.i.1ff); but the Jātaka (i.77ff, extends this period to seven weeks, the additional weeks being inserted between the first and second.  The Buddha spends one week each at the Animisa-cetiya, the Ratanacankama and the Ratanaghara, and this last is where he thinks out the Abhidhamma Pitaka.[/p][/blockquote][p][/p][p]Doubts now assail the Buddha as to whether he shall proclaim to the world his doctrine, so recondite, so hard to understand.  The Brahma Sahampati (according to J.i.81, with the gods of the thousand worlds, including Sakka, Suyāma, Santusita, Sunimmita, Vasavatti, etc.) appears before him and assures him there are many prepared to listen to him and to profit by his teaching, and so entreats him to teach the Dhamma.  The Buddha accedes to his request and, after consideration, decides to teach the Dhamma first to the Pañcavaggiyas at Isipatana.  On the way to  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"]Benares[/a] he meets the Ājīvaka Upaka and tells him that he (the Buddha) is Jina.  On his arrival at Isipatana the Pañcavaggiyas are, at first, reluctant to acknowledge his claim to be the Tathāgata, but they let themselves be won over and, on the full-moon day of Āsālha, the Buddha preaches to them the sermon which came to be known as the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta.  (Vin.i.4ff; M.i.118ff; cp.  D.ii.36ff.  Regarding the claim of this sutta to be the Buddha's first sermon, see Thomas, op.  cit., p.86; see also Pañcavaggiyā).  At the end of the sermon Kondañña becomes a sotāpanna and they all become monks.[/p][p][/p][p]This sermon is followed five days later by the Anattalakkhana Sutta, at the conclusion of which all five become arahants.  The following day the Buddha meets Yasa, whom he converts.  Yasa's father, who comes seeking him, is the first to take the threefold formula of Refuge.[/p][p][/p][p]Yasa becomes an arahant and is ordained.  The Buddha accepts a meal at his house, and Yasa's mother and one of his former wives are the first two lay-women to become the Buddha's disciples.  Then four friends of Yasa and, afterwards, fifty more, enter the Order and become arahants.  There are now sixty arahants besides the Buddha, and they are sent in different directions to preach the Dhamma.  They return with many candidates for admission to the Order, and the Buddha, who up till now had ordained men with the "ehi bhikkhu" formula, now allows the monks themselves to perform the ceremony of ordination (Vin.i.15ff; J.i.81f).[/p][p][/p][p]After spending the rainy season at Benares (about this time Māra twice tries to tempt the Buddha, once after he had sent the disciples out to preach and once after the Retreat, S.i.105, 111; Vin.i.21, 22), the Buddha returns to Senānigāma in Uruvela, on the way converting and ordaining the thirty Bhaddavaggiyā.  At Uruvela, after a long and protracted exercise of magical powers, consisting in all of three thousand five hundred miracles, the Buddha wins over the three Kassapa brothers, the Tebhātika Jatilā, with their thousand followers, and ordains them.  They become arahants after listening to the Ādittapariyāya Sutta preached at Gayāsīsa; with these followers he visits Rājagaha, where King Seniya Bimbisāra comes to see him at the Latthivanuyyāna.  The following day the Buddha and the monks visit the palace, preceded by Sakka disguised as a youth and singing the praises of the Buddha.  After the meal, the king gifts Veluvana to the Buddha and the Order.  The Buddha stays for two months at Rājagaha (BuA.4), and it is during this time that Sāriputta and Moggallāna join the Order, through the instrumentality of Assaji (Vin.i.23ff).  It was probably during this year, at the beginning of the rainy season, that the Buddha visited Vesāli at the request of the Licchavis, conveyed through Mahāli.  The city was suffering from pestilence and famine.  The Buddha went, preached the Ratana Sutta and dispelled all dangers (DhA.iii.436ff).[/p][p][/p][p]The number of converts now rapidly increases and the people of Magadha, alarmed by the prospect of childlessness, widow-hood, etc., blame the Buddha and his monks.  The Buddha, however, refutes their charges (Vin.i.42f).[/p][p]The account of the first twenty years of the Buddha's ministry is summarised from various sources, chiefly from Thomas's admirable account in his Life and Legend of the Buddha (pp.97ff).  The necessary references are to be found under the names mentioned.[/p][p][/p][p]On the full-moon day of Phagguna (February-March) the Buddha, accompanied by twenty thousand monks, sets out for Kapilavatthu at the express request of his father, conveyed through Kāludāyī.  (This visit is not mentioned in the Canon; but see Thag.527-36; AA.i.107, 167; J.i.87; DhA.i.96f; ThagA.i.997ff).  [/p][p][/p][p]By slow stages he arrives at the city, where he stays at the Nigrodhārāma, and, in order to convince his proud kinsmen of his power, performs the Yamakapātihārjya and then relates the Vessantara Jātaka.  The next day, receiving no invitation to a meal, the Buddha begs in the streets of the city; this deeply grieves Suddhodana, but later, learning that it is the custom of all Buddhas, he becomes a sotāpanna and conducts the Buddha and his monks to meal at the palace.  There all the women of the palace, excepting only Rāhulamātā, come and do reverence to the Buddha.  Mahā Pajāpatī becomes a sotāpanna and Suddhodana a sakadāgāmi.  The Buddha visits Rāhulamātā in her own apartments and utters her praises in the Candakinnara Jātaka.  The following day the Buddha persuades his half-brother, Nanda, to come to the monastery, where he ordains him and, on the seventh day, he does the same with Rāhula.  This is too great a blow for Suddhodana, and at his request the Buddha rules that no person shall be ordained without the consent of his parents.  The next day the Buddha preaches to Suddhodana, who becomes an anāgāmī.  During the Buddha's visit to Kapilavatthu, eighty thousand Sākyans join the Order, one from each family.  With these he returns to Rājagaha, stopping on the way at Anupiya, where Anuruddha, Bhaddiya, Ananda, Bhagu, Kimbila and Devadatta, together with their barber, Upāli, visit him and seek ordination.[/p][p][/p][p]On his return to Rājagaha the Buddha resides in the Sītavana.  (J.i.92, the story is also told in the Vinaya ii.154, but no date is indicated).  There Sudatta, later known as Anāthapindika, visits him, is converted, and invites him to Sāvatthi.  The Buddha accepts the invitation and journeys through Vesāli to Sāvatthi, there to pass the rainy season.  (Vin.ii.158; but see BuA.3, where the Buddha is mentioned as having spent the vassa in Rājagaha).  Anāthapindika gifts Jetavana, provided with every necessity, for the residence of the Buddha and his monks.  Probably to this period belongs the conversion of Migāra, father-in-law of Visākhā, and the construction, by Visākhā, of the Pubbārāma at Sāvatthi.  The vassa of the fourth year the Buddha spends at Veluvana, where he converts Uggasena.  (DhA.iv.59f).  In the fifth year Suddhodana dies, having realised arahant-ship, and the Buddha flies through the air, from the Kūtāgārasālā in Vesāli where he was staying, to preach to his father on his death-bed.  According to one account it is at this time that the quarrel breaks out between the Sākyans and the Koliyans regarding the irrigation of the river Rohinī.  (AA.i.186; SNA.i.357; ThigA.141; details of the quarrel are given in J.v.412ff).  The Buddha persuades them to make peace, and takes up his abode in the Nigrodhārāma.  Mahā Pajāpatī Gotamī, with other Sākiyan women, visits him there and asks that women may be allowed to join the Order.  Three times the request is made, three times refused, the Buddha then returning to Vesāli.  The women cut off their hair, don yellow robes and follow him thither.  Ananda intercedes on their behalf and their request is granted.  (Vin.ii.253ff; A.iv.274f.; for details see Mahā Pajāpati).[/p][p]In the sixth year the Buddha again performs the Yamakapātihāriya, this time at the foot of the Gandamba tree in Sāvatthi.  Prior to this, the Buddha had forbidden any display of magic powers, but makes an exception in his own case (DhA.iii.199f.; J.iv.265, etc.).[/p][p][/p][p]He spends the vassa at Mankulapabbata.  After the performance of the miracle he follows the custom of all Buddhas and ascends to Tāvatimsa in three strides to preach the Abhidhamma to his mother who is born there as a deva, and there he keeps the seventh vassa.  The multitude, gathered at Sāvatthi at the Yamakapātihāriya, refuse to go away until they have seen him.  For three months, therefore, Moggallāna expounds to them the Dhamma, while Culla Anāthapindika provides them with food.  During the preaching of the Abhidhamma, Sāriputta visits the Buddha daily and learns from him all that has been recited the previous day.  At the end of the vassa, the Buddha descends a jewelled staircase and comes to earth at Sankassa, thirty leagues from Sāvatthi.  (For details see Devorohana).  It was about this time, when the Buddha's fame was at its height, that the notorious Ciñcā-mānavikā was persuaded by members of some hostile sect to bring a vile accusation against the Buddha.  A similar story, told in connection with a paribbājikā named Sundarī, probably refers to a later date.[/p][p][/p][p]The eighth year the Buddha spends in the country of the Bhaggas and there, while residing in Bhesakalāvana near Sumsumāragiri, he meets Nakulapitā and his wife, who had been his parents in five hundred former births (A.A.i.217).  [/p][p]The same is told of another old couple in Sāketa.  See the Sāketa Jātaka.  The Buddha evidently stayed again at Sumsumāragiri many years later.  It was during his second visit that Bodhirājakumāra (q.v.) invited him to a meal at his new palace in order that the Buddha might consecrate the building by his presence.[/p][p][/p][p]In the ninth year the Buddha is at Kosambī.  While on a visit to the Kuru country he is offered in marriage Māgandiyā, the beautiful daughter of the brahmin Māgandiyā.  The refusal of the offer, accompanied by insulting remarks about physical beauty, arouses the enmity of Māgandiyā who, thenceforward, cherishes hatred against the Buddha.[/p][p]SN., pp.163ff; SNA.ii.542ff; DhA.i.199ff Thomas (op.  cit., 109) assigns the Māgandiyā incident to the ninth year.  I am not sure if this is correct, for the Commentaries say the Buddha was then living at Sāvatthi.[/p][p][/p][p]In the tenth year there arises among the monks at Kosambī a schism which threatens the very existence of the Order.  The Buddha, failing in his attempts to reconcile the disputants, retires in disgust to the Pārileyyaka forest, passing on his way through Bālakalonakāragāma and Pācīnavamsadāya.  In the forest he is protected and waited upon by a friendly elephant who has left the herd.  The Buddha spends the rainy season there and returns to Sāvatthi.  By this time the Kosambī monks have recovered their senses and ask the Buddha's pardon.  This is granted and the dispute settled.  (Vin.i.337ff; J.iii.486f; DhA.i.44ff; but see Ud.iv.5; s.v.  Pārileyyaka).[/p][p][/p][p]In the eleventh year the Buddha resides at the brahmin village of Ekanālā and converts Kasi-Bhāradvāja (SN., p.12f.; S.i.172f).  The twelfth year he spends at Verañjā, keeping the vassa there at the request of the brahmin Verañja.  But Verañja forgets his obligations; there is a famine, and five hundred horse-merchants supply the monks with food.  Moggallāna's offer to obtain food by means of magic power is discouraged (Vin.iii.1ff; J.iii.494f; DhA.ii.153).  The thirteenth Retreat is kept at Cālikapabbata, where Meghiya is the Buddha's personal attendant (A.iv.354; Ud.iv.1).  The fourteenth year is spent at Sāvatthi, and there Rāhula receives the upasampadā ordination.[/p][p][/p][p]In the fifteenth year the Buddha revisits Kapilavatthu, and there his father-in-law, Suppabuddha, in a drunken fit, refuses to let the Buddha pass through the streets.  Seven days later he is swallowed up by the earth at the foot of his palace (DhA.iii.44).[/p][p]The chief event of the sixteenth year, which the Buddha spent at Ālavī, is the conversion of the yakkha Ālavaka.  In the seventeenth year the Buddha is back at Sāvatthi, but he visits Ālavī again out of compassion for a poor farmer who becomes a sotāpanna after hearing him preach (DhA.iii.262ff).  He spends the rainy season at Rājagaha.  In the next year he again comes to Ālavī from Jetavana for the sake of a poor weaver's daughter.  She had heard him preach, three years earlier, on the desirability of meditating upon death.  She alone gave heed to his admonition and, when the Buddha knows of her imminent death, he journeys thirty leagues to preach to her and establish her in the sotāpattiphala (DhA.iii.170ff).[/p][p][/p][p]The Retreat of this year and also that of the nineteenth are spent at Cālikapabbata.  In the twentieth year takes place the miraculous conversion of the robber Angulimāla.  He becomes an arahant and dies shortly after.  It is in the same year that Ananda is appointed permanent attendant on the Buddha, a position which he holds to the end of the Buddha's life, twenty-five years later (For details see Ananda).  The twentieth Retreat is spent at Rājagaha.[/p][p][/p][p]With our present knowledge it is impossible to evolve any kind of chronology for the remaining twenty-five years of the Buddha's life.  The Commentaries state that they were spent at Sāvatthi in the monasteries of Jetavana and Pubbārāma.  (E.g., BuA.3; SNA.  p.336f, says that when the Buddha was at Sāvatthi, he spent the day at the Migāramātupāsāda in the Pubbārāma, and the night at Jetavana or vice versa).[/p][p][/p][p]This, probably, only implies that the Retreats were kept there and that they were made the head quarters of the Buddha.  From there, during the dry season, he went every year on tour in various districts.  Among the places visited by him during these tours are the following:[/p][ul][li][p]Aggālavacetiya, Anotatta, Andhakavinda, Ambapālivana, Ambalatthikā, Ambasandā, Assapura, Āpana, Icchānangala, Ukkatthā (Subhagavana), Ukkācelā, Ugganagara, Ujuññā (Kannakatthaka deer-park), Uttara in Koliya, Uttarakā, Uttarakuru, Uruvelakappa, Ulumpa, Ekanālā, Opasāda, Kakkarapatta, Kajangalā (Mukheluvana), Kammāssadhamma, Kalandakanivāpa (near Benares), Kimbilā, Kītāgiri, Kundadhānavana (near Kundakoli), Kesaputta, Kotigāma, Kosambī (Ghositārāma and Badarikārāma), Khānumata, Khomadussa, Gosingasālavana, Candalakappa, Campā (Gaggarā), Cātuma, Cetiyagiri in Vesāli, Jīvakambavana (in Rājagaha), Tapodārāma, Tindukkhānu (paribbājakārāma), Todeyya, Thullakotthita, Dakkhināgiri, Dandakappa, Devadaha, Desaka in the Sumbha country, Nagaraka, Nagaravinda, Nādikā (Giñjakāvasatha), Nālandā (Pāvārika mango-grove), Nālakapāna (Palāsavana), Pankadhā, Pañcasalā, Pātikārāma, Beluva, the Brahma world, Bhaddavatī, Bhaddiya (Jātiyāvana), Bhaganagara (Anandacetiya), Maninālakacetiya, Mana-sākata, Mātulā, Mithilā (Makhādeva mango-grove), Medatalumpa, Moranivāpa, Rammaka's hermitage, Latthivana, Videha, Vedhañña-ambavana, Venāgapura, Verañjā, Veludvāra, Vesāli (also various shrines there, Udenacetiya, Gotamacetiya, Cāpalacetiya, Bahuputta-kacetiya, Sattambacetiya, Sārandadacetiya), Sakkara, Sajjanela, Salalāgāraka in Sāvatthi, Sāketa (Añjanavana), Sāmagāma, Sālavatikā, Sālā, Simsapāvana, Silāvatī, Sītavana, Sūkarakhatalena, Setavyā, Hatthigāma, Halidavassana and the region of the Himālaya.[/li][/ul][p][/p][p]There is a more or less continuous account of the last year of the Buddha's life.  This is contained in three suttas: the Mahā Parinibbāna, the Mahā Sudassana and the Janavasabha.  These are not separate discourses but are intimately connected with each other.  The only event prior to the incidents recounted in these suttas, which can be fixed with any certainty, is the death of the Buddha's pious patron and supporter, Bimbisāra, which took place eight years before the Buddha's Parinibbāna (Mhv.ii.32).  It was at this time that Devadatta tried to obtain for himself a post of supremacy in the Order, and, failing in this effort, became the open enemy of the Buddha.  Devadatta's desire to deprive the Buddha of the leadership of the Sangha seems to have been conceived by him, according to the Vinaya account (Vin.ii.184), almost immediately after he joined the Order, and the Buddha was warned of this by the devaputta Kakudha.  This account lends point to the statement contained especially in the Northern books, that even in their lay life Devadatta had always been Gotama's rival.  [/p][p][/p][p]Enlisting the support of Ajātasattu, he tried in many ways to kill the Buddha.  Royal archers were bribed to shoot the Buddha, but they were won over by his personality and confessed their intentions.  Then Devadatta hurled a great rock down Gijjhakūta on to the Buddha as he was walking in the shade of the hill; the hurtling rock was stopped by two peaks, but splinters struck the Buddha's foot and caused blood to flow; he suffered great pain and had to be taken to the Maddakucchi garden, where his injuries were dressed by the physician Jīvaka (S.i.27).  The monks wished to provide a guard, but the Buddha reminded them that no man had the power to deprive a Tathāgata of his life.[/p][p][/p][p]Devadatta next bribed the royal elephant keepers to let loose a fierce elephant, Nālāgiri, intoxicated with toddy, on the road along which the Buddha would go, begging for alms.  The Buddha was warned of this but disregarded the warning, and when the elephant appeared, Ananda, against the strict orders of the Buddha, threw himself in its path, and only by an exercise of iddhi-power, including the folding up of the earth, could the Buddha come ahead of him.  As the elephant approached, the Buddha addressed it, pervading it with his boundless love, until it became quite gentle.  (This incident, with great wealth of detail, is related in several places - e.g., in J.v.333ff).[/p][p][/p][p]These attempts to encompass the Buddha's death having failed, Devadatta, with three others, decides to create a schism in the Order and asks the Buddha that five rules should be laid down, whereby the monks would be compelled to lead a far more austere life than hitherto.  When this request is refused, Devadatta persuades five hundred recently ordained monks to leave Vesāli with him and take up their residence at Gayāsīsa, where he would set up an organisation similar to that of the Buddha.  But, at the Buddha's request, Sāriputta and Moggallāna visit the renegade monks; Sāriputta preaches to them and they are persuaded to return.  When Devadatta discovers this, he vomits hot blood and lies ill for nine months.  When his end approaches, he wishes to see the Buddha, but he dies on the way to Jetavana - whither he is being conveyed in a litter - and is born in Avīci.[/p][p][/p][p]From Gijjhakūta, near Rājagaha, the Buddha starts on his last journey.  Just before his departure he is visited by Vassākāra, and the talk is of the Vajjians; the Buddha preaches to Vassākāra and the monks on the conditions that lead to prosperity.  The Buddha proceeds with a large concourse of monks to Ambalatthikā and thence to Nālandā, where Sāriputta utters his lion-roar (sīhanāda) regarding his faith in the Buddha.  The Buddha then goes to Pātaligāma, where he talks to the villagers on the evil consequences of immorality and the advantages of morality.  He utters a prophecy regarding the future greatness of Pātaliputta and then, leaving by the Gotamadvāra, he crosses the river Ganges at Gotamatittha.  He proceeds to Kotigāma and thence to Ñātika, where he gives to Ananda the formula of the Dhammādāsa, whereby the rebirth of disciples could be ascertained.  From Ñātika he goes to Vesāli, staying in the park of the courtesan Ambapāli.  The following day he accepts a meal from Ambapāli, refusing a similar offer from the Licchavis; Ambapāli makes a gift of her park to the Buddha and his monks.  The Buddha journeys on to Beluva, where he spends the rainy season, his monks remaining in Vesāli.  At Beluva he falls dangerously ill but, with great determination, fights against his sickness.  He tells Ananda that his mission is finished, that when he is dead the Order must maintain itself, taking the Dhamma alone as its refuge, and he concludes by propounding the four subjects of mindfulness (D.ii.100).  The next day he begs in Vesāli and, with Ananda, visits the Cāpāla-cetiya.  There he gives to Ananda the opportunity of asking him to live until the end of the kappa, but Ananda fails to take the hint.  Soon afterwards Māra visits the Buddha and obtains the assurance that the Buddha's nibbāna will take place in three months.  There is an earthquake, and, in answer to Ananda's questions, the Buddha explains to him the eight causes of earthquakes.  This is followed by lists of the eight assemblies, the eight stages of mastery and the eight stages of release.  The Buddha then repeats to Ananda his conversation with Māra, and Ananda now makes his request to the Buddha to prolong his life, but is told that it is now too late; several opportunities he has had, of which he has failed to avail himself.  The monks are assembled in Vesāli, in the Service Hall, and the Buddha exhorts them to practise the doctrines he has taught, in order that the religious life may last long.  He then announces his impending death.[/p][p][/p][p]According to the Commentaries (e.g., DA.ii.549), after the rainy season spent at Beluva, the Buddha goes back to Jetavana, where he is visited by Sāriputta, who is preparing for his own Parinibbāna at Nālakagāma.  From Jetavana the Buddha went to Rājagaha, where Mahā-Moggallāna died.  Thence he proceeded to Ukkācelā, where he spoke in praise of the two chief disciples.  From Ukkācelā he proceeded to Vesāli and thence to Bhandagāma.  Rāhula, too, predeceased the Buddha (DA.ii.549).[/p][p][/p][p]The next day, returning from Vesāli, he looks round at the city for the last time and goes on to Bhandagāma; there he preaches on the four things the comprehension of which destroys rebirth-noble conduct, earnestness in meditation, wisdom and freedom.[/p][p][/p][p]He then passes through the villages of Hatthigāma, Ambagāma and Jambugama, and stays at Bhoganagara at the Ananda-cetiya.  There he addresses the monks on the Four Great Authorities (Mahāpadesā), by reference to which the true doctrine may be determined (Cf.  A.ii.167ff).  From Bhoganagara the Buddha goes to Pāvā and stays in the mango-grove of Cunda, the smith.  Cunda serves him with a meal which includes sūkaramaddava.  (There is much dispute concerning this word.  See Thomas, op.  cit., 149, n.3).  The Buddha alone partakes of the sūkaramaddava, the remains being buried.  This is the Buddha's last meal; sharp sickness arises in him, with flow of blood and violent, deadly pains, but the Buddha controls them and sets out for Kusinārā.  On the way he has to sit down at the foot of a tree.  Ananda fetches him water to drink from the stream Kakutthā, over which five hundred carts had just passed; but, through the power of the Buddha, the water is quite clear.  Here the Buddha is visited by Pukkusa, the Mallan, who is converted and presents the Buddha with a pair of gold-coloured robes.  The Buddha puts them on and Ananda notices the marvellous brightness and clearness of the Buddha's body.  The Buddha tells him that the body of a Buddha takes on this hue on the night before his Enlightenment and on the night of his passing away, and that he will die that night at Kusinārā.  He goes to the Kākutthā, bathes and drinks there and rests in a mango-grove.  There he instructs Ananda that steps must be taken to dispel any remorse that Cunda may feel regarding the meal he gave to the Buddha.[/p][p][/p][p]From Kakutthā the Buddha crosses the Hiraññavatī to the Upavattana sāla-grove in Kusinārā.  There Ananda prepares for him a bed with the head to the north.  All the trees break forth into blossom and flowers cover the body of the Buddha.  Divine mandārava-flowers and sandalwood powder fall from the sky, and divine music and singing sound through the air.  But the Buddha says that the greater honour to him would be to follow his teachings.[/p][p]The gods of the ten thousand world systems assemble to pay their last homage to the Buddha, and Upavāna, who stands fanning him, is asked to move away as he obstructs their view.[/p][p][/p][p]Ananda asks for instruction on several points, including how the funeral rites should be performed; he then goes out and abandons himself to a fit of weeping; the Buddha sends for him, consoles him and speaks his praises.  Ananda tries to persuade the Buddha not to die in a mud-and-wattle village, such as is Kusinārā, but the Buddha tells him how it was once the mighty Kusāvatī, capital of Mahāsudassana.[/p][p][/p][p]The Mallas of Kusināra are informed that the Buddha will pass away in the third watch of the night, and they come with their families to pay their respects.  The ascetic Subhadda comes to see the Buddha and is refused admission by Ananda, but the Buddha, overhearing, calls him in and converts him.  Several minor rules of discipline are delivered, including the order for the excommunication of Channa.  The Buddha finally asks the assembled monks to speak out any doubts they may have.  All are silent and Ananda expresses his astonishment, but the Buddha tells him it is natural that the monks should have no doubts.  Then, addressing the monks for the last time, he admonishes them in these words: "Decay is inherent in all component things; work out your salvation with diligence." These were the Buddha's last words.  Passing backwards and forwards through various stages of trance, he attains Parinibbāna.  There is a great earthquake and terrifying thunder, and the Brahmā Sahampati, Sakka king of the gods, Anuruddha and Ananda utter stanzas, each proclaiming the feeling uppermost in his mind.  It is the full-moon day of the month of Visākha and the Buddha is in his eightieth year.[/p][p][/p][p]The next day Ananda informs the Mallas of Kusinārā of the Buddha's death, and for seven days they hold a great celebration.  On the seventh day, following Ananda's instructions, they prepare the body for cremation, taking it in procession by the eastern gate to the Makutabandhana shrine, thus altering their proposed route, in order to satisfy the wishes of the gods, as communicated to them by Anuruddha.  The whole town is covered knee-deep with mandārava-flowers, which fall from the sky.  When, however, four of the chief Mallas try to light the pyre, their attempt is unsuccessful and they must wait until Mahā Kassapa, coming with a company of five hundred monks, has saluted it.  The Commentaries (e.g., DA.ii.603) add that Mahā Kassapa greatly desired that the Buddha's feet should rest on his head when he worshipped the pyre.  The wish was granted: the feet appeared through the pyre, and when Kassapa had worshipped them, the pyre closed together.  The pyre burns completely away, leaving no cinders nor soot.  Streams of water fall from the sky to extinguish it and the Mallas pour on it scented water.  They then place a fence of spears around it and continue their celebrations for seven days.  At the end of that period there appear several claimants for the Buddha's relics: Ajātasattu, the Licchavis of Vesāli, the Sākiyans of Kapilavatthu, the Bulis of Allakappa, the Koliyas of Rāmagāma, a brahmin of Vethadīpa and the Mallas of Pāvā.  But the Mallas of Kusinārā refusing to share the relics with the others, there is danger of war.  Then the brahmin Dona counsels concord and divides the relics into eight equal parts for the eight claimants.  Dona takes for himself the measuring vessel and the Moriyas of Pipphalivana, who arrive late, carry off the ashes.  Thūpas were built over these remains and feasts held in honour of the Buddha.  [/p][p][/p][p]The concluding passage of the Mahā-Parinibbāna Sutta (D.ii.167) states that the Buddha's relics were eight measures, seven of which were honoured in Jambudīpa and the remaining one in the Nāga realm in Rāmagāma.  One tooth was in heaven, one in Gandhāra, a third in Kālinga (later taken to Ceylon), and a fourth in the Nāga world.  Ajātasattu's share was deposited in a thūpa and forgotten.  It was later discovered by Asoka (with the help of Sakka) and distributed among his eighty-four thousand monasteries.  Asoka also recorded the finding of all the other relics except those deposited in Rāmagāma.  These were later deposited in the Mahācetiya at Anurādhapura (Mhv.xxxi.17ff).  Other relics are also mentioned, such as the Buddha's collar-bone, his alms bowl, etc.  (Mhv.xvii.9ff; Mhv.i.37, etc.).[/p][p][/p][p]It is said (E.g., DA.iii.899) that just before the Buddha's Sāsana disappears completely from the world, all the relics will gather together at the Mahācetiya, and travelling from there to Nāgadīpa and the Ratanacetiya, assemble at the Mahābodhi, together with the relics from other parts.  There they will reform the Buddha's golden hued body, emitting the six-coloured aura.  The body will then catch fire and completely disappear, amid the lamentations of the ten thousand world-systems.[/p][p][/p][p]The Ceylon Chronicles (Mhv.i.12ff; Dpv.i.45ff; ii.1ff etc.) record that the Buddha visited the Island on three separate occasions.  [/p][blockquote][p](The Burmese claim that the Buddha visited their land and went to the Lohitacandana Vihāra, presented by the brothers Mahāpunna and Cūlapunna of Vānijagāma (Ind.  Antiq.xxii., and Sās.36f.).  [/p][/blockquote][p]The first was while he was dwelling at Uruvelā, awaiting the moment for the conversion of the Tebhātika Jatilas, in the ninth month after the Enlightenment, on the full-moon day of Phussa (Dec.-Jan.).  He came to the Mahānāga garden, and stood in the air over an assembly of yakkhas then being held.  He struck terror into their hearts and, at his suggestion, they left Ceylon and went in a body to Giridīpa, hard by.  The Buddha gave a handful of his hair to the deva Mahāsumana of the Sumanakūta mountain, who built a thūpa which was later enlarged into the Mahiyangana Thūpa.  The Buddha again visited Ceylon in the fifth year, on the new-moon day of Citta (March-April), to check an imminent battle between two Nāga chiefs in Nāgadīpa; the combatants were Mahodara and Cūlodara, uncle and nephew, and the object of the quarrel was a gem-set throne.  The Buddha appeared before them, accompanied by the deva Samiddhi-Sumana, carrying a Rājayatana tree from Jetavana, settled their quarrel and received, as a gift, the throne, the cause of the trouble.  He left behind him both the throne and the Rājayatana tree for the worship of the Nāgās and accepted an invitation from the Nāga king, Maniakkhika of Kalyāni, to pay another visit to Ceylon.  Three years later Maniakkhika repeated the invitation and the Buddha came to Kalyāni with five hundred monks, on the second day of Vesākha.  Having preached to the Nāgas, he went to Sumanakūta, on the summit of which mountain he left the imprint of his foot (Legend has it that other footprints were left by the Buddha, on the bank of the river Nammadā, on the Saccabaddha mountain and in Yonakapura).  He then stayed at Dīghavāpī and from there visited Mahāmeghavana, where he consecrated various spots by virtue of his presence, and proceeded to the site of the later Silācetiya.  From there he returned to Jetavana.[/p][p][/p][p]Very little information as to the personality of the Buddha is available.  We are told that he was golden-hued (E.g., Sp.iii.689), that his voice had the eight qualities of the Brahmassāra (E.g., D.ii.211; M.ii.166f.  It is said that while an ordinary person spoke one word, Ananda could speak eight; but the Buddha could speak sixteen to the eight of Ananda, MA.i.283) - fluency, intelligibility, sweetness, audibility, continuity, distinctness, depth and resonance - that he had a fascinating personality - he was described by his opponents as seductive (E.g., M.i.269, 275) - that he was handsome, perfect alike in complexion and stature and noble of presence (E.g., M.ii.167).  He had a unique reputation as a teacher and trainer of the human heart.  He was endowed with the thirty-two marks of the Mahāpurisa.  (For details of these, see Buddha).  There is a legend that Mahā Kassapa, though slightly shorter, resembled the Buddha in appearance.[/p][p][/p][p]Attempts made, however, to measure the Buddha always failed; two such attempts are generally mentioned - one by a brahmin of Rājagaha and the other by Rāhu, chief of the Asuras (DA.i.284f).  The Buddha had the physical strength of many millions of elephants (e.g., VibhA.397), but his strength quickly ebbed away after his last meal and he had to stop at twenty-five places while travelling three gāvutas from Pāvā to Kusināra (DA.ii.573).[/p][p][/p][p]Mention is often made of the Buddha's love of quiet and peace, and even the heretics respected his wishes in this matter, silencing their discussions at his approach (E.g., D.i.178f; iii.39; even his disciples had a similar reputation, e.g., D.iii.37).  Examples are given of the Buddha refusing to allow noisy monks to live near him.  (E.g., M.i.456; see also M.ii.122, where a monk was jogged by his neighbour because he coughed when the Buddha was speaking).  He loved solitude and often spent long periods away from the haunts of men, allowing only one monk to bring him his meals.  E.g., S.v.12, 320; but this very love of solitude was sometimes brought against him.  By intercourse with whom does he attain to lucidity in wisdom? they asked.  His insight, they said, was ruined by his habit of seclusion (D.iii.38).[/p][p][/p][p]According to one account (A.i.181), it was his practice to spend part of the day in seclusion, but he was always ready to see anyone who urgently desired his spiritual counsel (E.g., A.iv.438).[/p][p][/p][p]In the Mahā Govinda Sutta (D.ii.222f ) Sakka is represented as having uttered "eight true praises" of the Buddha.  Perhaps the most predominant characteristics of the Buddha were his boundless love and his eagerness to help all who sought him.  His fondness for children is seen in such stories as those of the two Sopākas, of Kumāra-Kassapa, of Cūla Panthaka and Dabba-Mallaputta and also of the novices Pandita and Sukha.  His kindness to animals appears, for instance, in the introductory story of the Maccha Jātaka and his interference on behalf of Udena's aged elephant, Bhaddavatikā (q.v.).  The Buddha was extremely devoted to his disciples and encouraged them in every way in their difficult life.  The Theragāthā and the Therīgāthā are full of stories indicating that he watched, with great care, the spiritual growth and development of his disciples, understood their problems and was ready with timely interference to help them to win their aims.  Such incidents as those mentioned in the Bhaddāli Sutta (M.i.445), the introduction to the Tittha Jātaka and the Kañcakkhandha Jātaka, seem to indicate that he took a personal and abiding interest in all who came under him.  It was his unvarying custom to greet with a smile all those who visited him, inquiring after their welfare and thus putting them at their ease (Vin.i.313).  When anyone sought permission to question him, he made no conditions as to the topic of discussion.  This is called sabbaññupavārana.  E.g., M.i.230. When the Buddha himself asked a question of any of his interrogators, they could not remain silent, but were bound to answer; a yakkha called Vajirapāni was always present to frighten those who did not wish to do so (e.g., M.i.231).  [/p][p][/p][p]The Buddha was not over-anxious to get converts, and when his visitors declared themselves his followers he would urge them to take time to consider the matter - e.g., in the case of Acela Kassapa and Upāligahapati.[/p][p][/p][p]When he was staying in a monastery, he paid daily visits to the sick ward to talk to the inmates and to comfort them (See, e.g., Kutāgārasālā).  The charming story of Pūtigata-Tissa shows that he sometimes attended on the sick himself, thus setting an example to his followers.  In return for his devotion, his disciples adored him, but even among those who immediately surrounded him there were a few who refused to obey him implicitly - e.g., Lāludāyī, the companions of Assaji and Punabbasuka, the Chabbaggiyas, the Sattarasavaggiyas and others, not to mention Devadatta and his associates.[/p][p]The Buddha seems to have shown a special regard for Sāriputta, Ananda and Mahā Kassapa among the monks, and for Anāthapindika, Mallikā, Visakhā, Bimbisāra and Pasenadi among the laity.  He seems to have been secretly amused by the very human qualities of Pasenadi and by his failure to appreciate the real superiority of Mallikā, his wife.[/p][p][/p][p]The Buddha always declared that he was among the happy ones of this earth, that he was far happier, for instance, than Bimbisāra (E.g., M.i.94), and he remained unmoved by opposition or abuse.  E.g., in the case of the organised conspiracy of Māgandiyā (DhA.iv.1f.).[/p][p][/p][p]The Milindapañha (p.134) mentions several illnesses of the Buddha: the injury to his foot has already been referred to; once when the humours of his body were disturbed Jīvaka administered a purge (Vin.i.279); on another occasion he suffered from some stomach trouble which was cured by hot water, or, according to some, by hot gruel (Vin.i.210f.; Thag.185).  The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iv.232; ThagA.i.311f) mentions another disorder of the humours cured by hot water obtained from the brahmin Devahita, through Upavāna.  The Commentaries mention that he suffered, in his old age, from constant backache, owing to the severe austerities practised by him during the six years preceding his Enlightenment, and the unsuitable meals taken during that period were responsible for a dyspepsia which persisted throughout the rest of his life (SA.i.200), culminating in his last serious illness of dysentery.  MA.i.465; DA.iii.974; see also D.iii.209, when he was preaching to the Mallas of Pāvā.[/p][p][/p][p]The Apadāna (Ap.i.299f) contains a set of verses called Pubbakammapiloti; these verses mention certain acts done by the Buddha in the past, which resulted in his having to suffer in various ways in his last birth.  He was once a drunkard named Munāli and he abused the Pacceka Buddha Surabhi.  On another occasion he was a learned brahmin, teacher of five hundred pupils.  One day, seeing the Pacceka Buddha Isigana, he spoke ill of him to his pupils, calling him "sensualist." The result of this act was the calumny against him by Sundarikā in this life.[/p][p][/p][p]In another life he reviled a disciple of a Buddha, named Nanda; for this he suffered in hell for twelve thousand years and, in his last life, was disgraced by Ciñcā.  Once, greedy for wealth, he killed his step-brothers, hurling them down a precipice; as a result, Devadatta attempted to kill him by hurling down a rock.  Once, as a boy, while playing on the highway, he saw a Pacceka Buddha and threw a stone at him, and as a result, was shot at by Devadatta's hired archers.  In another life he was a mahout, and seeing a Pacceka Buddha on the road, drove his elephant against him; hence the attack by Nālāgiri.  Once, as a king, he sentenced seventy persons to death, the reward for which he reaped when a splinter pierced his foot.  Because once, as a fisherman's son, he took delight in watching fish being caught, he suffered from a grievous headache when Vidūdabha slaughtered the Sākiyans.  In the time of Phussa Buddha he asked the monks to eat barley instead of rice and, as a result, had to eat barley for three months at Verañja.  (According to the Dhammapada Commentary [iii.257], the Buddha actually had to starve one day at Pañcasālā, because none of the inhabitants were willing to give him alms.) Because he once killed a wrestler, he suffered from cramp in the back.  Once, when a physician, he caused discomfort to a merchant by purging him, hence his last illness of dysentery.  As Jotipāla, he spoke disparagingly of the Enlightenment of Kassapa Buddha, and in consequence had to spend six years following various paths before becoming the Buddha.  He was one of the most short-lived Buddhas, but because of those six years his Sāsana will last longer (Sp.i.190f).  [/p][p][/p][p]The Buddha was generally addressed by his own disciples as Bhagavā.  He spoke of himself as Tathāgata, while non-Buddhists referred to him as Gotama or Mahāsamana.  Other names used are Mahāmuni, Sākyamuni, Jina, Sakka (e.g., Sn.vs.345) and Brahma (Sn.vs.91; SnA.ii.418), also Yakkha (q.v.).[/p][p][/p][p]The Anguttara Nikāya (A.i.23ff) gives a list of the Buddha's most eminent disciples, both among members of the Order and among the laity.

He warned his men that they should not eat anything found in the forest without first consulting him.  On the way they came across leaves strewn in the forest, covered with honeycomb.  These had been placed there by a yakkha, named Gumbiya, who had put poison in the honey.  Some of the men ate the honey, while others remembered the warning of the Bodhisatta as soon as they had tasted it.  Those who ate died, the others were given emetics and recovered.[/p][p]The story was related to a monk who, fascinated by a woman's charm, wished to become a layman.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Gangātīriya Thera[/div][p]An arahant.  He was a householder named Datta of Sāvatthi.  On discovering that he had, though unwittingly, committed incest with both his mother and sister, he was overcome with anguish and left the world.  He adopted a course of austerity, dwelling in a hut of palm leaves on the bank of the Ganges, hence his name.  For a whole year he kept silence; in the second year he spoke but once to a woman who, in filling his bowl, spilt the milk, wishing to discover if he were dumb.  In the third year he became an arahant.[/p][p]In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a householder, and supplied drinks to monks (Thag.v.127-8; ThagA.i.248f).[/p][p]It is said (ThagA.195f.; Thig.224f) that after Gangātiriya's conception his mother was driven out of her house in the absence of her husband, her mother-in-law suspecting her of infidelity.  The child was born in a travellers' rest-house in Rājagaha, whither she had gone in search of her husband, and was taken away by a caravan leader who happened to see it when its mother was away bathing.  Later the woman was carried away by a robber chief, by whom she had a daughter.  One day, in a quarrel with her husband, she threw her daughter on the bed, wounding her on the head, and fearing her husband's wrath she fled to Rājagaha, where she became a courtesan and later mistress of Gangātiriya, who was unaware of his relationship to her.  Some time afterwards he took to wife the robber's daughter as well.  One day, while looking at the young wife's head, the older one saw the wound, and as a result of her questions learnt the truth.  Filled with dismay, both mother and daughter became nuns, and Gangātiriya left the world as mentioned above.[/p][p]Gangātiriya is perhaps to be identified with Udakadāyaka of the Apadāna.

Kākavannatissa, hearing of this, sent for him to the court (Mhv.xxiii.49ff; the Rasavāhini ii.28, says he subdued a yakkha named Jayasena).  He took a prominent part in the attack on Vijitapura, using a coconut-palm as weapon (Mhv.xxv.27, 32, 44f).[/p][p]It is said (MT.452) that in the time of Kassapa Buddha he gave daily milk rice to the monks.[/p][p]See also Ras.ii.87f, which says that he was so called because he was short, but that according to the Uttara-vihāra monks he was given the name because, when he went hunting, he killed animals by dashing them on kotthayimbara-trees.  Once when he was holding a feast in his house, after defeating the Damilas, a Yakkha, named Jayasena of Aritthapabbata, happened to pass by, and, entering the house, fell in love with G.'s wife.  G.  challenged him to a fight and defeated him.  He celebrated the victory for seven days and went to the palace drunk.  Being refused admission, he swam across to Kāvīrapattana, and, having gone as far as the Himālaya in search of holy monks, was about to kill himself in despair when an arahant Thera appeared before him and ordained him.

Among the assembled multitude was a villager, who felt that he would die unless he could obtain a morsel of Gandha's rice.  When this was told to Gandha he suggested that the man should work for him for three years, taking in payment a bowl of his rice.  The villager agreed and henceforth became known as Bhattabhatika.  At the end of the three years Gandha kept his promise and gave orders that Bhattabhatika should enjoy all his master's own splendours for one day, and asked all the members of his household, except his wife Cintāmanī, to wait on him.  When Bhattabhatika sat down to eat, a Pacceka Buddha appeared before him; Bhattabhatika gave his food to the Pacceka Buddha who, in sight of all those that had gathered to watch Bhattabhatika's splendour, went through the air to Gandhamādana.

He was unmarried and supported his blind parents.  He had as pupil Mūsila from Ujjeni, and to him Guttila taught all he knew.  Later, Guttila introduced Mūsila at the king's court where, as soon as he had the ear of the king, he arranged for a competition with his master, that the king might decide who should be the court musician.  Guttila, fearing a contest in his old age, fled into the forest where Sakka appeared before him and promised to help him to victory.  The contest was held, and when Guttila played according to Sakka's instructions, the sound of his music filled the city and heavenly nymphs descended to earth to dance.  Mūsila was defeated and stoned to death by the enraged crowd.  Later, Sakka sent Mātali to fetch Guttila to Tāvatimsa in his chariot, and as a return for his music Guttila was allowed to discover to what good deeds the inhabitants of Tāvatimsa owed their birth there.  On returning to earth after seven days, he told the people what he had seen and exhorted them to do good (J.ii.248ff; VvA.137ff).[/p][p]It is said that once Guttila sent a thousand to a woman, wishing to win her favour, but she would not grant it.  He decked himself, and in the evening sang and played his lute outside her house.  She was so enthralled by his music that she opened her window and, thinking it was a door, walked out and was killed by the fall (AA.i.16f; is this perhaps a different person?).[/p][p]Guttila is mentioned (Mil.115, 291) as one of the four human beings who went to Tāvatimsa even in their human body, the others being Sādhīna, Nimi and Mandhātā.[/p]</e>

It is said (MA.ii.717) that the Buddha wished to make known to the monks the great piety of Ghatīkāra.

He took Dīghatālā first, with the sweetmeats intended for her relations, and persuaded her to come with him, leaving her husband.

In the course of the quarrel between the two men they came to where Mahosadha held court, and be, having heard their respective stories, decided, with the approval of the assembled populace, in favour of Golakāla.[/p][p]It is said Golakāla was so called because he was dwarfish, like a ball (gola), and black (kāla).

People went there, offered sacrifices to the gods, recited the Vedas, and immersed themselves in the water.[/p][p]Elsewhere (ThagA.i.388f, 418; Thag.v.287) it is stated that every year, in the earlier half of the month of Phagguna (March), people held a bathing festival at the bathing ghat at Gayā, the festival being called Gayāphaggunī.

Udena suggested that the money might be utilised to build an assembly-hall for the Order at Pātaliputta.  The suggestion was agreed to and the assembly-hall, when built, was called Ghotamukhī (M.ii.157ff).[/p][p]The Commentary (MA.ii.786f) adds that Ghotamukha held the view that one should seek self-glorification, even by the slaughter of one's parents, and that he was the only person born in heaven, in spite of having held that view.  After his birth in heaven, having discovered the cause of his good fortune, be came to earth in disguise and, after revealing his identity to his only remaining sister, told her where his treasures were hidden and instructed her to spend some of the money on renovating an old refectory which the monks were trying to restore.[/p]</e>

Elsewhere (p.269), the Tīkā speaks of a Gokannatittha in the neighbourhood of the estuary of the Mahākandara-nadī, and the Cūlavamsa (lxxi.18) mentions Gokanna as the last of a series of fords in Rohana, important from a strategic point of view, along the Mahā-vālkaugangā, from "Sarogāmatittha to Gokanna." In another passage (Cv.xli.79), Gokanna(ka) is spoken of as mahannava (the ocean).  These facts support Geiger's conjecture (Cv.

He fled, therefore, to Kālavāpi and, on various occasions, offered battle to the forces of Parakkamabāhu, but everywhere he was defeated, the worst reverse being at Nīlagala by the general Māyāgeha.  After that he built a fortification in Kālavāpi, where he lived in comparative quiet.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Garahadinna[/div][p]A resident of Sāvatthi and friend of Sirigutta.  The latter was a follower of the Buddha, and the former of the Niganthas.  Instigated by the Niganthas, Garahadinna constantly blamed his friend for his allegiance to the Buddha, until one day, in exasperation, Sirigutta invited the Niganthas to his house in order to prove that their claim to omniscience was false.  To this end he had a ditch dug and filled with filth, ropes stretched longitudinally over the ditch, and the seats so arranged that the moment the Niganthas sat down they would be tipped over and flung into the ditch.  The Niganthas arrived, and everything happened as Sirigutta had arranged.  Garahadinna, filled with desire for revenge, hid his resentment and invited the Buddha and his disciples with the intention of humiliating them.  He employed the same stratagem as his friend, except that the ditch was filled with glowing coals instead of with filth.  The Buddha came, knowing all that had happened, and by an exercise of iddhi-power caused large lotus flowers to spring up from the bed of coals.  Sitting thereon, he created an abundant supply of food and preached the Dhamma.  Garahadinna, Sirigutta, and many others became sotāpannas (DhA.i.434f).[/p][p]On this occasion was also preached the Khadirangāra Jātaka.

At Rājagaha, Bimbisāra built a hut for him but forgot the roof.  The gods prevented rain from falling till this error was rectified.  Godhika and his friends had been companions in good deeds in the past, especially in the time of Siddhattha Buddha and of Kassapa Buddha.  Eighty-seven kappas ago Godhika was seven times king, under the name of Mahāsena (Thag.vs.51; ThagA.i.123f; Ap.i.140).[/p][p]According to the Samyutta (S.i.120f; SA.i.144f; also DhA.i.431f ) account, Godhika lived on the Kālasilā in Isigilipassa.  There he made various vain attempts to win arahantship (the DhA.i.431f adds that he suffered from a disease brought about by hard work), achieving only temporary emancipation of mind, from which he then fell away.  Six times this happened and then he decided to commit suicide by cutting his throat.  Māra saw this and reported it to the Buddha, but when the Buddha arrived it was too late and Godhika lay "supine on his couch with his shoulders twisted around." The Buddha, however, declared that Godhika had attained Nibbāna.  The Commentary states that, after cutting his throat, Godhika so checked his final agony that he won arahantship.[/p]</e>

Its capital was Takkasilā, famous for its university; its king in the time of the Buddha was Pukkusāti.  There was friendly intercourse between him and Bimbisāra of Magadha.  Merchants and visitors from one country to another were lodged and fed at the expense of the country's king, and no tariffs were levied on their merchandise.  There was constant exchange of goods and valuables, and on one occasion Bimbisāra, wishing to send his friend a gift of particular value, despatched to him a letter containing news of the appearance in the world of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha.  When Pukkusāti read the letter he decided to become a follower of the Buddha, and ordained himself as a monk; then, leaving his kingdom, he travelled all the way to Sāvatthi to see the Buddha (MA.ii.979ff).  This conversion of Gandhāra's' king, however, does not seem to have had the effect of converting the rest of its people to the Buddha's faith.  The memory of Pukkusāti was evidently soon forgotten, for we find Moggaliputta Tissa, at the conclusion of the Third Council, sending the Thera Majjhantika to convert Gandhāra (Mhv.xii.3ff).[/p][p]According to Buddhaghosa's account, Pukkusāti's kingdom was over one hundred leagues in extent (MA.ii.988), and the distance from Takkasilā to Sāvatthi was one hundred and ninety-two leagues (MA.ii.987; from Benares it was one hundred and twenty leagues, vīsamyo-janasata; J.i.395; ii.47).  There was evidently a well-known caravan route linking the two countries, although Gandhāra was regarded as a paccantima janapada.  (MA.ii.982; there was also constant trade between Gandhāra and Videha, J.iii.365ff.  It would appear from the Mahā Niddesa i.154 that Takkasilā was a regular centre of trade).[/p][p]At the time of Majjhantika's visit, the people of Gandhāra were being harassed by the Nāga-king Aravāla, and the chronicles contain details of his conversion by the monk.  The Nāga-king, together with his retinue, the yakkha Pandaka and his wife Hāritā, became devout followers of the Buddha.  Majjhantika preached the Āsīvisūpama Sutta, and many thousands joined the Order.  (Mhv.xii.9ff; Smp.i.64f; Dpv.viii.4).[/p][p]Gandhāra appears to have included Kasmīra, the two countries being always mentioned together as Kasmīra-Gandhāra.  They occupied the sites of the modern districts of Peshawar and Rawalpindi in the northern Punjab (PHAI.  p.93).  In the time of Asoka the country formed part of his empire, and is mentioned as such in Rock Edict V.  Before that it was subject to the Achaemenid kings.  Gandhāra was always famous for its red woollen shawls (kambala) (SNA.ii.487; J.vi.501).[/p][p]Another king of Takkasilā besides Pukkusāti is mentioned - namely, Naggaji, who was a contemporary of Nimi, king of Videha.

Their most important heresy seems to have been that they considered all sankhāras, without qualification, no better than a heap of embers (kukkula) whence the flames have died out as from an inferno of ashes.  They based this view on the Buddha's declaration made in the Adittapariyāya Sutta ("All is on fire, bhikkhus") (Kvu.ii.7, p.208, and Points of Controversy, 127f).  This view was probably responsible for their other name of (Kukkulikas or Kukkutikas) (Rockhill, 186ff).  It may be that Kukkulika was their earlier name, of which Gokulikā was either a corruption or a derivation from the name of one of their teachers.  But all Pāli records give only the "Gokulika" reading.[/p]</e>

Godha Jātaka (No.138).-The Bodhisatta was once born as a lizard and paid homage to a good ascetic living near the ant-hill where he dwelt.  The good ascetic left and was replaced by a wicked one, to whom the Bodhisatta paid like homage.  One day, the villagers brought a dish of lizard's flesh to the ascetic.  Being attracted by its flavour, he planned to kill the Bodhisatta, that he might have more of the flesh.  But the Bodhisatta discovered his intention just in time, and, making good his escape, denounced the hypocrite.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to a wicked monk.  J.i.480f.[/p][hr][p]2. Godha Jātaka (No.141).-The Bodhisatta was born once as an iguana, leader of many others.  His son became intimate with a young chameleon, whom he used to clip and embrace.  The Bodhisatta warned his son against this unnatural intimacy, but, finding his advice of no avail, and knowing that danger would come to them through the chameleon, he prepared a way of escape, should the need arise.  The chameleon, growing tired of the friendship with the iguana, showed a trapper the home of the iguanas.  The trapper made a fire round the hole and killed many of the iguanas as they tried to escape, but the Bodhisatta reached safety through the hole he had provided.[/p][p]The story was told about a treacherous monk, identified with the young iguana (J.i.487f).  For details see the Mahilāmukha Jātaka.[/p][hr][p]3. Godha Jātaka (No.325).-The story of the past is very similar to No.1 above, except that there is only mention of one ascetic and he is a hypocrite.  The young lizard threatened to expose the ascetic's hypocrisy and compelled him to leave the hermitage.  The story was related in reference to a monk who was a cheat and a rogue (J.iii.84f).[/p][p]Cf.  the Kuhakabrāhmana Vatthu (DhA.iv.154f.).[/p][hr][p]4. Godha Jātaka (No.333).-A prince and his wife, returning after a long journey, were greatly distressed by hunger, and some hunters, seeing them, gave them a roasted lizard.  The wife carried it in her hand, hanging it from a creeper.  Arriving at a lake, they sat down at the foot of a tree, and while his wife was away fetching water the prince ate the whole lizard.  When his wife came back, he told her that the lizard had run away, leaving only the tail in his hand.  Later, the prince became king, but his wife, though appointed queen consort, received no real honour.  The Bodhisatta, who was the king's minister, wishing to see justice done to the queen, contrived that the king should be reminded of his ingratitude by allusion being made to the incident of the roast lizard.  The king thereupon realised his neglect of his dutiful wife, and conferred on her supreme power.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to a couple who had been given a roast lizard, when returning from a journey undertaken to collect debts.  The husband ate the whole lizard when his wife was away.  She said nothing and drank some water to appease her hunger, but when they visited the Buddha, and be asked her if her husband were good and affectionate, she replied in the negative.  The Buddha then told her the story of the past.  J.iii.106f.; cf.  Succaja Jātaka.[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Ghositārāma[/div][p]A monastery in Kosambī, built by Ghosita (Ghosaka, q.v.) for the use of the Buddha and the monks.  The Buddha often stayed there during his visits to Kosambī and numerous incidents are mentioned in the books in connection with the monastery.  It was because of a dispute between two monks of the Ghositārāma, one expert in the Vinaya and one in the Dhamma, that the first schism arose in the Order, driving the Buddha himself to seek quiet in the Pārileyyaka forest.  Vin.i.337f; M.i.320; DhA.i.44ff; the Kosambī monks were evidently somewhat peculiar (see Vin.iv.197).[/p][p][/p][p]Even at other times the Buddha seems to have sought solitude in this forest during his sojourns at the Ghositārāma (See, e.g., S.iii.96f).  It was here that the Buddha decreed the ukkhepaniyakamma for Channa, who refused to acknowledge and atone for his offences (Vin.ii.21f), and here that he laid down the procedure in that connection to be followed.  Devadatta was at Ghositārāma when he first conceived the idea of using Ajātasattu for his own ends (Vin.ii.184f).  The Buddha was there at the time and it is said that the devaputta Kakudha appeared before Mahā-Moggallāna to warn him of Devadatta's schemes.  The information was reported to the Buddha, who warned Moggallāna not to pass it on to others.  The Buddha then proceeded to tell Moggallāna of the five kinds of teachers which appear in the world (A.iii.122f).  Ananda is several times spoken of as staying in the Ghositārāma, sometimes with the Buddha, sometimes alone.  On one such occasion he asks the Buddha why women should suffer from certain disabilities as compared with men (A.ii.82).  And again (A.iii.132f), what are the circumstances which conduce to ease (phāsuvihāra) in the case of monks? Could it be said of a follower of the Buddha that his attainments depend on the length of time during which he has observed the Buddha's teachings? Once Ananda visits (A.iv.37f), at her request, a nun living near by reported to be ill and enamoured of him.  The mere sight of him causes her recovery, but he preaches to her on the impermanent nature of the body and makes her realise the truth (A.ii.144f).  Among those who visit Ananda at the Ghositārāma and discuss various matters with him are mentioned: Ghosita (S.iv.113), Unnābha (S.v.271f.), a householder, follower of the Ajivikas (A.i.217f.), and Bhaddaji (A.iii.202).  Udāyī twice visits him there, once to ask for a description of consciousness (S.iv.169f.), and again to quote a verse uttered by Pañcālacanda devaputta and to ask Ananda to explain it (A.iv.449).  We find him also joining in a discussion which ensued on a sermon to the monks by Ananda (A.iv.426f.).  Udāyī preached to large audiences at the Ghositārāma and was evidently appreciated, for we find Ananda reporting it to the Buddha and being told that it is no easy matter to preach to a large assembly with acceptance (A.iii.184f.).  The Yuganaddha Sutta is a discourse preached by Ananda to the monks at the Ghositārāma of his own accord (A.ii.156f.).  Channa is several times mentioned in connection with incidents taking place at the Ghositārāma.  Mention has already been made of the ukkhepa-niyakamma declared on him.  A devoted householder, wishing to build a vihāra for him, asked him for a site.  Vin.iii.155f; mention is made of other misdemeanours which he committed in order to have a fine vihāra (Vin.iv.47).[/p][p]Channa started cutting down trees and other things, in order to clear the site, and this led to great uproar.  On another occasion he is reported to the Buddha for refusing to listen to his colleagues and the Buddha chides him (Vin.iii.77, also iv.35f, 113. See also S.iii.132f).  It was when Channa was at the Ghositārāma that Ananda came, at the bidding of the monks, to inflict on him the brahmadanda (Vin.ii.292).[/p][p][/p][p]Among others mentioned as staying at the Ghositārāma are Mūsila, Savittha, Nārada, in the company of Ananda (S.ii.115), Pindola Bhāradvāja - who converts Udena when the latter comes to see him (S.iv.110f.) and earns the Buddha's praises for his attainments (S.v.224) - Sāriputta and Upavāna (S.v.76), and Bāhiya and Anuruddha (A.ii.239).  Anuruddha is there at the time of the schism of the Kosambī monks but refuses to intervene.  He indulges, instead, in his powers of clairvoyance and mention is made of a visit paid to him by the Manāpakāyika-devas (A.iv.262f).[/p][p][/p][p]Dāsaka and a number of other monks were once staying in the Ghositārāma; on learning that Khemaka lies ill in the Badarikārāma, one gāvuta away, the others send Dāsaka several times to and fro to ask various questions of Khemaka.  In the end, Khemaka himself comes to them to solve their difficulties (S.iii.126f).[/p][p][/p][p]See also Kosambiya Sutta, Jāliya Sutta, Sandaka Sutta, Upakkilesa Sutta and Sekha Sutta, Dalhadhamma Jātaka, Kosambī Jātaka and Suripāna Jātaka, all preached while the Buddha was staying at the Ghositārāma.[/p][p][/p][p]Thirty thousand monks from the Ghositārāma, under the leadership of Urudhammarakkhita, were present at the foundation of the Mahā Thūpa at Anurādhapura.

On leaving the world with his brothers and becoming an ascetic, he gathered round him a company of two hundred other ascetics.  They all lived at Gayāsīsa, hence his name (Gayāsīse pabbajito ti Gayā Kassapo nāma jāto).  When Uruvela-Kassapa was converted, Gayā-Kassapa, with his followers, joined the Order, and at the conclusion of the Adittapariyāya Sutta they all became arahants (Vin.i.33f.; AA.i.165).  Gayā-Kassapa is reported (Thag.v.345f) to have said that he used to bathe three times a day at Gayātittha, in order to wash away his sins during the festival of Gayāphaggu.[/p][p]In the time of Sikhī Buddha he was a householder, and later became a forest-dwelling hermit.  One day he saw the Buddha walking alone in the forest and offered him a kola-fruit (ThagA.i.417f).[/p][p]He is evidently identical with Koladāyaka of the Apadāna.  Ap.ii.379; see also ii.483.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Gayā Sutta[/div][p]Preached at Gayāsīsa.  The Buddha describes to the monks some of the stages through which he passed before reaching Enlightenment.  At first he could only sec the light from the bodies of the devas; later, through conscious striving, he could distinguish their forms, talk with them, discover how they came to be born in their different spheres; then he was able to read their past births, and at last he attained to supreme knowledge.

The elephant returned, dropped some dung on him and, making water over him, killed him on the spot.[/p][p][/p][p]The story was told in reference to a monk who quelled the pride of a rowdy; the latter used to molest monks who went for alms to a village near Jetavana, asking them questions and insulting them so much that the monks were reluctant to go there.  One day a monk, stronger than the rest, enticed the man out of the village, felled him with one blow, and threatened to teach him another lesson if he did not cease pestering the monks.  After that the man decamped at the sight of a monk.  J.ii.209ff.[/p]</e>

The ox, incensed by this cruelty, assumed a human voice and, chiding him for his base ingratitude, cursed him.  Godatta, much moved, renounced all his property and joined the Order, in due course attaining arahantship (ThagA.i.555f).  [/p][p]The Theragāthā (vs.659-72) contains several stanzas attributed to him, wherein he discoursed to "Ariyan" groups, both lay and religious, on lokadhammā (the nature of things?), illustrating his meaning with a wealth of simile.  He is probably the Godatta of the Godatta Sutta.[/p][hr][p][b]2. Godatta Thera[/b].-His full name was Abhidhammika Godatta, showing that he was considered expert in Abhidhamma.  He was evidently a well-known Abhidhamma commentator and is quoted in the Visuddhi Magga (p.138), but it is said that his explanation was rejected in the Commentaries because it was only the Elder's personal view.  [/p][p]The Samantapāsādika (ii.307, also 478; iii.588), however, relates a story showing that the Elder was recognised as an authority on the Vinaya.  A monk of Antarasamudda made a drinking bowl out of a coco-nut shell and, leaving it in the monastery, went to Cetiyagiri.  Another monk, fancying the bowl, stole it and also went to Cetiyagiri, where he met the owner and was charged with theft.  Unable to settle the dispute where they were, they went to the Mahāvihāra.  There, by beating of drums, the monks were assembled near the Mahācetiya, and convicted the accused of theft, holding him guilty of a pārājikā offence.  [/p][p]Godatta, being interviewed, pointed out that the value of the bowl was only a penny or two and that the Buddha had nowhere laid down that the theft of such an insignificant object could be held a pārājikā offence.  His decision was greeted with applause, and when the report thereof reached the reigning king, Bhātiya, he decreed that, henceforth, in all their disputes, his subjects should abide by the decision of Godatta.  v.l.

He was a Lambakanna of Mahiyangana, and having gone to Anurādhapura with Sanghatissa and Sanghabodhi, he, with their help, slew the reigning king, Vijaya, and they reigned in succession (Mhv.xxxvi.58).  Gothakābhaya became Sanghabodhi's treasurer but, seeing the king's weakness, he led a rebellion against him and captured the throne (vv.91, 98-117; for details see Sanghabodhi).  In addition to other religious works, he built the Meghavannābhaya-Vihāra.  He banished from Abhayagiri sixty monks who had accepted the Vetulla heresy, but a Cola monk, Sanghamitta, defeated in discussion the thera Gothābhaya, the king's uncle, and became the king's favourite, obtaining the position of tutor to the king's two sons, Jetthatissa and Mahāsena.

He was learned in the Vedas and was an unrivalled orator.  When the Buddha came to Sāvatthi for the dedication of Jetavana, he heard the Buddha preach and entered the Order, attaining arahantship in the tonsure-hall.  When he returned to Sāvatthi, after a long residence in the Kosala country, many of his relations, eminent brahmins, came to him and counselled him as to the various gospels (suddhivādā) current among the people; he told them of the Buddha's teaching.

When the latter, during his flight from his brother, wished to give alms to a monk before eating, Gotama knew his desire and sent a monk named Tissa to accept the alms.  When the food was brought to Piyangudīpa, Gotama offered morsels of it to five hundred monks (twelve thousand, according to Mhv.xxxii.65) and, refilling the bowl with scraps of food, sent it back by air to the prince (Mhv.xxiv.24, 30; MT.465).[/p][hr][p]5. Gotama.-The name of the clan to which the Buddha and the Sākiyans belonged.  The members of the clan, though khattiyas, claimed descent from a brahmin isi, Gotama (For an explanation of this see Thomas, op.  cit., 22f).  Gotama and Angiras are both enumerated in the Pravara ceremony as the ancestors of the Gotama clan (Asvalāyana, Srauta-sūtra, 12, 11, 1).[/p][p]Late Buddhists appear to have forgotten the Vedic rsi, for, according to an ancient legend, Okkāka, the immediate ancestor of the Sākiyans, was born of an egg formed of the coagulated blood and semen of an ascetic Gotama, as he lay impaled for the alleged murder of a courtesan.  The egg was hatched by the sun (Mtu.i.338ff; Rockhill, Buddha, 9f).[/p][p]Gotama is the name by which the Buddha is addressed by brahmins and others who are not his followers.  In one place, at least, the Buddha is represented as addressing the Sākiyans as "Gotamā." (S.iv.183).  The Gotama-gotta is classed among the higher gottas, together with such gottas as Moggallāna, Kaccāyana and Vāsettha (Vin.iv.6; DA.i.246f, uccākula-paridīpanam).  According to the Theragāthā Commentary (ii.204; also AA.i.395; Gotama-buddhassa sāvako pi Gotamo), the Buddha's disciples (e.g., in the case of Vangisa) were also called Gotama, even when they did not naturally belong to that clan.

(Dial.i.222; but see his article on Buddhist Law in ERE.; see also Brethren 265, n.3).  The Lalita-vistara (p.492), however, speaks of the Gautamas in a list of nine such sects; the Gotamakas and the Gautamas are evidently identical, as several of the other classes correspond with the Pāli.  According to the Lalita-vistara, these sects existed even before the Buddha, for they are represented as meeting and addressing him in the sixth week after the Enlightenment, on his way to the Ajapāla-tree.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Guttasāla, Guttasālaka[/div][p]A village and a district in Rohana.  Dutthagāmanī lived there before being crowned at Mahāgāma (Mhv.xxiv.17).  Guttasāla was thirty to thirty-five miles to the north of Mahāgāma, where the high road crossed the Mānikagañga, and lay on the main route which spread from Mahāgāma to Mutiyangana, and from there along the Mahāvālukagangā to Pulatthipura; hence its strategic importance.  It was the centre of several campaigns at different periods.  (E.g., of Mahinda, Cv.li.109, 117; Vijayabāhu I., Cv.lxviii.34; Jayabāhu I., Cv.lxi.12; Parakkamabāhu I., Cv.lxxiv.165f.; lxxv.15.

[/p][p]The Atthasālinī (DhsA.398f) records the story of a nun of Guttasāla; she was an arahant, and when the village was destroyed by bandits she left it with a young nun carrying her baggage.  At the village gate of Nakulanagara she met Mahānāga of Kālavallimandapa, who offered her a meal in his own bowl, as she had none of her own.  She ate the meal, washed the bowl and returned it, telling him that from the next day he would get alms without exertion; and so he did.[/p]</e>

[/p][p]There the Sammajjanakavāta sweeps the ground, the Samakaranavāta levels the sand, and the Siñcanakavāta sprinkles water from Anotatta.  [/p][p]The Sugandhakaranavāta brings all the perfumes of Himavā, the Ocinakavāta plucks flowers, and the Santharanakavāta spreads them.  [/p][p]In the māla seats are always ready for the Pacceka Buddhas, who on fast days and on their own birthdays assemble there.  When a new Pacceka Buddha arises in the world, he goes first to Gandha-mādana and other Pacceka Buddhas, who may be in the world, assemble there to greet him, and they all sit rapt in samādhi.  Then the senior among them asks the new-comer to describe how he came to be a Pacceka Buddha (SNA.i.52, 66f; ii.437; AA.ii.759; UdA.300, etc.; MA.ii.585).  [/p][p]The Pacceka Buddhas who live on Gandhamādana will often enter into samādhi for seven days, and at the end of that period seek alms from someone on whom they wish to bestow a special favour, that he may thereby obtain merit (E.g., DhA.iii.368f; iv.121, 199f; J.iv.16).  These Buddhas will sometimes leave the mountain, and, having admonished those whom they wish to help, return again (E.g., J.iii.453).

  <e>[div class="huge"]Gangā [/div][hr][p]1. Gangā (Modern Ganges).-One of the five great rivers (Mahānadī) that water Jambudīpa, the others being Yamunā, Aciravatī, Sarabhū, and Mahī (E.g., Vin.ii.237; S.ii.135; v.401; A.iv.101; v.22; Mil.114 mentions ten).  [/p][p][/p][p]The Commentaries (E.g., SNA.ii.438f; AA.ii.761ff; MA.ii.586; UdA.301) give a long description of their origin.  From the Anotatta lake flow four rivers: that from the south circles the lake three times under the name of Avattagangā, then as Kanhagangā flows straight for sixty leagues along the surface of a rock, comes into violent contact with a vertical rock, and is thrown upwards as a column of water three gāvutas in circumference; this column, known as Akāsagangā, flows through the air for sixty leagues, falls on to the rock Tiyaggala, excavating it to a depth of fifty leagues, thus forming a lake which is called Tiyaggalapokkharanī; then the river, under the name of Bahalagangā, flows through a chasm in the rock for sixty leagues, then, under the name of Ummaggagangā, through a tunnel for a further sixty leagues, and finally coming upon the oblique rock Vijjha, divides into five streams, forming the five rivers above mentioned.  [/p][p][/p][p]Among places mentioned as being on the banks of the Gangā are Benāres, Campā, Ayojjha, Kimbhilā, Ukkāvelā, Payāga, Pātaliputta, and Sankassa.  The Gangā formed one of the most important means of communication and trade for the districts through which it flowed - e.g., from Rājagaha to Vesāli.  The district to the north of the river and bordering on the kingdom of Anga was called Anguttarāpa (SNA.ii.439).  The river was five hundred leagues in length (SA.ii.119).[/p][p][/p][p]The name of the Gangā appears again and again in similes and metaphors in the Pāli books: [/p][ul][li][p]its sands are immeasurable (S.iv.376); [/li][li][p]its waters cannot be made bracken by adding to them a grain of salt (A.i.250); [/li][li][p]it is full of foam, and yet its foam is empty (S.iii.140); [/li][li][p]it were folly to wish to hold up the course of its waters with one's fist (S.iv.298); [/li][li][p]as the river finds repose only in the ocean, so do the followers of the Buddha find repose only in nibbāna (M.i.493);[/li][li][p]some things are as inevitable as that the Gangā should flow into the sea (S.iv.179); [/li][li][p]there is no such thing as the Gangā apart from its sand, its water, and its banks; [/li][li][p]to be cast on the other side of the Gangā (pāragangāya) is great misfortune (see, e.g., S.i.207, SnA.i.228).  [/li][li][p]The Gangā flows from west to east (pācīnaninnā, S.iv.191); [/li][li][p]during the rains it is so full of water that even a crow could drink water from its bank (Vin.i.230); [/li][li][p]sometimes the banks would be flooded and the buildings on them destroyed (SA.i.164), and people would find difficulty in crossing; [/li][li][p]at others it was shallow and could be crossed by means of a reed bridge (SnA.i.18); [/li][li][p]cattle could easily be driven from one bank to another (M.i.225).  [/li][li][p]At various spots were ferries where boatmen plied for hire (e.g., J.iii.230).  [/li][li][p]On its banks, on the higher reaches, were numerous snakes and parrots (J.ii.145, iii.491), [/li][li][p]and all along the banks were hermitages (e.g., J.iii.476, v.191, etc.).  [/li][li][p]Men always bathed in the river, and on festival days even women of very good family came for water-sports, sometimes spending the whole day in the river; kings also came with their retinues (e.g., J.i.295; MA.ii.604; DhA.iii.199).  [/li][/ul][p]Reference is also made to a Gangāmahīkīlā, (Smp.  on Vin.i.191, and again, ii.276).  Buddhaghosa says that Mahī here refers to the earth, but Rhys Davids (VT.ii.25, n.3) thinks it refers to the river of that name.[/p][p][/p][p]The junction of the Gangā and the Yamunā is frequently referred to, and is used as a simile for perfect union (e.g., J.vi.412, 415).  A tributary of the Gangā is mentioned which flows from Himavā, its name being Migasammatā (J.vi.72).  The ford at Pātaliputta, where the Buddha crossed on his way from Rājagaha to Vesāli, was called Gotamatittha (Vin.i.230); its distance from Rājagaha was five leagues, and from Vesāli three (KhpA.162-3).  When the Buddha, after curing the plague at Vesāli, returned to Rājagaha, great festivities marked the event, and the celebration was known as the Gangārohana.  The devas and the nāgas vied with each other to do honour to the Teacher, and there was a great assembly of all classes of beings, comparable to those on the occasions of the Twin Miracle and the Descent from Tusita (DhA.iii.444).  Among the nāgas who dwelt in the Gangā is mentioned Eraka (DhA.iii.231).[/p][p]The water of the Gangā was considered holy and was used for the consecration of kings, not only of India but also of Ceylon (Mhv.xi.30; MT.305).[/p][p]The people on the northern bank were rough and coarse, while those on the south were pious and generous, believers in the Buddha (DA.i.160).[/p][p]The upper reaches of the river were called Uddhagangā (J.ii.283, vi.427) or Uparigangā (J.iv.230), and the lower reaches Adhogangā (J.ii.283, 329, v.3).[/p][p]See also Kosikī, Bhagīrathī, Mahāgangā, and Pāragangā.[/p][hr][p][/p][p]2.

The subject of his talk was consummate energy (āraddhaviriya).  Sāriputta declares that, in comparison with Moggallāna, he himself is like a mound of gravel set up alongside the Himālaya.  Moggallāna returns the compliment by saying that, beside Sāriputta, he is like a pinch of salt set up alongside a large jar of salt, and recalls the high praise bestowed on Sāriputta by the Buddha himself.

They met in Himavā, but failed to recognise each other until, seeing another eclipse of the moon, they exchanged reminiscences.

One of his ministers misconducted himself in the royal harem and the king, catching him in the act, banished him.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Godhāvarī[/div][hr][p]1. Godhāvarī.  (v.l.  Godāvari).-A river in Dakkhināpatha, of which it forms the southern boundary.  During the Buddha's time, the Alaka (or Mulaka) king and the Assaka king (both Andhakas) had settlements on its northern bank, and Bāvarī's hermitage lay in the territory between their dominions (SN.vs.977).  The Commeutary (SNA.ii.581) says that near this spot the Godhāvarī divided into two branches, forming an island three leagues in extent, and the island was a dense forest, known as the Kapitthavana.  Bāvarī's hermitage occupied a region of five leagues.  In the past this region had been the abode of various sages, such as Sarabhanga (J.v.132, 136; Mtu.i.363).  According to the Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.182), Bāvarī's hermitage was on a bend of the river (Godhāvarīvanke).  The Godhāvarī is one of the holiest rivers in Southern India, rising in Brahmagiri near the village of Triyanvaka and sanctified by its connection with Rāma and various saints.[/p][p][/p][p]2. Godhāvarī.-A canal, built by Parakkamabāhu I., connecting the Kāragangā and the Parakkamasāgara (Cv.lxxix.57).[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Gangeyya[/div][hr][p]1. Gangeyya.-Adjective formed from Ganga (J.ii.151).

Each elephant had the strength of one hundred men.  MA.i.262; AA.ii.822; BuA.37.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Giribhanda-(vāhana)-pūjā[/div][p]A great festival, instituted by King Mahādāthika-Mahānāga on the Cetiyagiri mountain.  Carpets were laid from the Kadambanadī to the mountain, in order that people might approach the mountain with clean feet; the road was decorated and illuminated, shops were erected and largesse distributed.  There were mimes, songs and music.  Lamps were lit throughout the island and even on the sea for one yojana round (Mhv.xxxiv.75ff; AA.i.13).  It is said (Vsm.376; Vsm.Trs.ii.436, n.4) that on the day of the festival Māra, wishing to spoil it, rained down a shower of coal, but an Elder created earth in the sky, thus preventing the coal from falling.  The most costly offerings given during this feast to any monk - namely, a pair of garments - fell to the lot of a young novice, Lonagirivāsī Tissa, in spite of the efforts of the king's ministers to get them into the hands of the older monks.  It was because the novice had practised the sārānīya-dhammā (DA.ii.535; AA.ii.653f; MA.i.545f).[/p][p]The festival was probably connected with the Giribhanda-vihāra, in which case that was the reason for the name.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Guttilavimāna[/div][p]Moggallāna visits Tāvatimsa and, seeing thirty-six goddesses whose palaces were next to each other, questions them as to their acts in the past, and reports their answers to the Buddha.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Gandamba[/div][p]The mango-tree, at the gate of Sāvatthi, under which the Buddha performed the Yamaka-pātihāriya (q.v.).  The king's gardener, Ganda, while on his way to the palace to give the king a ripe mango-fruit from the palace gardens, saw the Buddha going on his alms-rounds and offered him the mango.  The Buddha ate it immediately, and gave the seed to Ananda to be planted by the gardener at the city-gate.  A tree of one hundred cubits sprouted forth at once, covered with fruit and flowers.  At the foot of this tree Vissakamma, by the order of Sakka, built a pavilion of the seven kinds of precious things.  J.iv.264f; J.i.88; DhA.iii.206ff; Mil.349.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Gagga Jātaka (No.155)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta was once a trader's son in Kāsi.  One day during their travels father and son were obliged to take lodging in a hall haunted by a yakkha.  In the case of persons occupying this hall, if one of them should happen to sneeze and the other failed, thereupon, to wish him long life, the yakkha was allowed to eat them.  This boon had been granted him in return for twelve years' services to Vessavana.  The two travellers from Kāsi took up their abode in the hall for one night, during which the father sneezed.  The son, knowing nothing of his danger, said nothing, but on seeing the yakkha preparing to eat him, he guessed the reason and hastened to wish his father long life.  The father acted likewise, and the yakkha was foiled in his attempt on their lives.  The Bodhisatta, having heard the yakkha's story, established him in the five precepts.  The story became known, and the Bodhisatta was given the post of general, while the yakkha was made tax-gatherer.  In the story the Bodhisatta addresses his father as Gagga.[/p][p]Once, when the Buddha was preaching, he sneezed, and all around him shouted "Long Life," thus interrupting his sermon.  The Buddha told them that the custom was superstitious, and forbade them to follow it.  On their obeying him, the common people blamed them for their lack of good manners.  The Buddha, thereupon, withdrew the injunction and related this story to account for the origin of the custom.  (J.ii.15f.; the introductory story is found in Vin.ii.140).[/p][p]Gagga is identified with Mahā Kassapa.  J.ii.17.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Ghatīkāra[/div][p]One of the great Brahmā.  In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a potter of Vehalinga, looking after his blind parents.  He was a very pious and devoted follower of the Buddha, ministering to him better than anyone else, and the Buddha accepted his invitation in preference to that of the king of Benares.  It is said that when the Buddha was in need of anything he would go to Ghatīkāra's house and take it, whether he were at home or not, so great was his confidence in Ghatīkāra's piety.  Once, when Ghatīkāra was absent, the people, at the Buddha's suggestion, took away the thatch from his house to roof the hut of Tathāgata.  For three months Ghatīkāra's house remained open to the sky, but no rain fell on it, so great was his faith (Mil.223f).  According to the Nalapāna Jātaka (J.i.172), no rain will ever fall on the site of Ghatīkāra's' house as long as this kappa lasts.[/p][p][/p][p]The Bodhisatta, who at the time of Ghatīkāra was a young brahmin named Jotipāla, was the friend of Ghatīkāra but had no faith in the Buddha, and Ghatīkāra, having failed to persuade him to visit the Buddha, in the end took him by force.  Jotipāla was converted and joined the Order, but Ghatīkāra, as the only support of his parents, could not renounce the world.  Kikī, king of Benares, having heard of his virtues from Kassapa Buddha, sent him five hundred cartloads of the choicest rice, etc., but Ghatīkāra returned the gifts, saying that he had plenty for himself (M.ii.46ff; S.i.35f; Bu.xxv.41; SnA.i.152).[/p][p][/p][p]After death, Ghatīkāra was born as a Mahābrahmā in the Avihā Brahma-world, and an anāgāmī.  He was evidently already a Sakadāgāmi before his death (see DhA.i.380), but he did not wish his attainments to be known (AA.i.44).[/p][p]He provided the Buddha with the eight requisites of a monk when the Buddha, having left the world, decided to lead the life of a bhikkhu (J.i.65; SnA.ii.382; BuA.236; VvA.314).  The begging bowl, then provided by him, vanished when the Buddha was given a bowl of milk rice by Sujātā (J.i.69).[/p][p][/p][p]According to the Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.35f; 60), Ghatīkāra visited the Buddha some time after the Enlightenment and the Buddha reminded him of their former friendship.  Ghatīkāra, on that occasion, speaks of several others (besides Jotipāla) who had been his friends in Vehalinga - Upaka, Phalaganda, Pukkusāti, Bhaddiya, Khandadeva, Bāhuraggi and Pingiya.  They had listened to the Buddha's teaching and, after death, were born in the Avihā-world, where he himself was.  In this context the Buddha addresses him as Bhaggava (q.v.).[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Gajabāhu, Gajabhuja[/div][p]King of Ceylon (1137-1153).  He was the son of Vikkamabāhu II.  and succeeded his father to the throne (Cv.lx.88, according to the Dimbulāgala Inscription, his mother was Sundarī).  Thus he was the grandson of Vijayabāhu I and of Tilokasundarī, and came, therefore, of Kālinga stock.  When he saw the increasing power of the Prince Parakkamabāhu (afterwards Parakkamabāhu I.), Gajabāhu sent for him with many marks of favour and welcomed him at his court.  In order to win the king's confidence Parakkama gave his sister Bhaddavati to be his queen, but when he saw that Gajabāhu was becoming suspicious of his power he left Pulatthipura and made preparations to wage war against him.  In the campaign that followed, Gajabāhu suffered many reverses and, in the end, fell into the hands of Parakkama's forces.  With great difficulty Parakkama saved him from death, but in the meantime Mānābharana managed to get Gajabāhu into his power and cast him into a dungeon.  From there he was rescued by Parakkamabāhu and fled to Kotthasāra.  Meanwhile, Parakkamabāhu had consolidated his power, and his officers captured Pulatthipura.  Gajabāhu, being able to see no other help, implored the monks of Pulatthipura to intercede on his behalf, and, at their request, Parakkamabāhu left to Gajabāhu the enjoyment of his possessions.  (This is rather odd, especially in view of the fact that he invited heretical nobles to come to Ceylon, Cv.lxx.53).  Gajabāhu took up his abode at Gangātalāka and spent his last days there in comparative peace.  As he had no heir and no brothers, he bequeathed his kingdom to Parakkamabāhu, and engraved his will on a stone tablet at Mandalagiri Vihāra.  He was cremated at Kotthasāra.  (Details of Gajabāhu's reign and his fights with Parakkamabāhu are contained in the Cūlavamsa, particularly in chapters 63, 66, 67, 70, 71).  See also Gajabāhukagāmani.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Giraggasamajjā[/div][p]A festival held from time to time (kālānukālam) in Rājagaha.  (Perhaps elsewhere as well.  The BuA.  p.102 says it was an annual festival held all over Jambudīpa and was as old as Dīpankara Buddha; see also J.iii.538).  It was held in the open air in the afternoon and was attended by all people of all grades of society from Anga and Magadha.  Special seats were prepared for the more eminent of the audience, and the festivities seem to have consisted chiefly of nautch dances (SNA.i.326).  According to the Vinaya accounts (Vin.ii.107f, 150; iv.85, 267) there were also singing and music, and the festival was attended not only by laymen, but also by members of religious orders, for otherwise it is unlikely that the Sattarasavaggiyas and the Chabbaggiyas would have been there.  Food was provided as well as amusements.  Buddhaghosa (Sp.iv.831) explains the name of the festival thus: giraggasamajjo ti girimhi aggasamajjo girissa vā aggadese sammajo, and tells us that it was announced for seven days before its commencement, and was held on level ground under a shadow of a hill and outside the city.  Perhaps it was originally a pagan religious festival, a survival of old exogamic communistic dancing (See Dial.i.7, n.4; VT.iii.71, n.3).[/p][p]It was at a Giraggasamajjā that Sāriputta and Moggallāna decided to leave the world (DhA.i.73f.; AA.i.89, etc.).[/p][p]The Sanskrit equivalent is Girivaggu-samāgama.

He had no children and was ugly; when he spoke saliva flowed from his mouth, and two beautiful women, standing beside him, wiped his face with blue lilies and threw them away.  When revellers had no money wherewith to buy flowers, they would stand outside Gorimanda's house and call out for him.  When he leaned out of the window to ask what they wanted, his face had to be wiped with lilies and the lilies were then thrown away.  The revellers picked them up, washed them, and wore them at their revels.  J.vi.367f.[/p]</e>

When the dog grew up, it used to accompany the herdsman on a visit to a Pacceka Buddha, who had meals in his house.  Sometimes, when the herdsman was unable to go himself, be would send the dog to summon the Pacceka Buddha.  The road led through a forest and the dog would bark aloud to frighten away the wild beasts.  One day, when the Pacceka Buddha went elsewhere, the dog died of a broken heart and was reborn in Tāvatimsa as the god Ghosa or Ghosaka.  [/p][p]He was later reborn as Ghosaka-setthi.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Gotamakacetiya[/div][p]A shrine near and to the south of Vesāli (D.iii.9).  It was considered one of the beautiful spots of that town (E.g., D.ii.102, 118) and the Buddha stayed there several times, particularly during the first years of his ministry (Thus AA.i.457).  During one such stay, he laid down the rule which allowed monks the use of three robes; he himself felt cold during the night and had to wear extra clothing (Vin.i.288; iii.195).[/p][p][/p][p]The shrine was pre-Buddhistic and dedicated to a Yakkha named Gotamaka.  A vihāra was later built on the spot for the Buddha and his monks (UdA.322; DhA.iii.246; AA.i.457; SNA.i.344).  [/p][p]There the Gotamaka Sutta was preached.

But when the horse came, Kundalī, not wishing to make herself cheap, kicked him on the jaw and nearly killed him.  The horse was ashamed and did not repeat his visit, and Kundalī died of love.[/p][p]The story was told to a landowner of Sāvatthi, with whom a beautiful woman fell desperately in love.  Her friends, with great difficulty, persuaded him to visit her one night, but she was capricious and rejected his advances.  He went away never to return, and she died of love.

According to him again (DA.ii.406; cf.iii.860, 872), Vāsettha's first visit to the Buddha was on the occasion of the preaching of the Vāsettha Sutta, at the conclusion of which he accepted the Buddha as his teacher.  He again did so, when, at his next visit, the Buddha preached to him the Tevijja Sutta.  Soon after, he entered the Order, and, at the conclusion of the preaching of the Aggañña Sutta, he was given the higher ordination and attained arahantship.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Vanavāsī [/div][hr][p][b]1. Vanavāsī (Vanavāsika) Tissa.  [/b] A monk.  In his previous birth he was the brahmin Mahāsena (q.v.).  During pregnancy his mother invited Sāriputta with five hundred monks, to her house, and fed them on milk rice.  She herself put on yellow robes and ate of the rice left by the monks.  On the day of his naming, he presented Sāriputta with his blanket.  He was called Tissa after Sāriputta, whose personal name was Upatissa.  At the age of seven Tissa joined the Order and his parents held a festival lasting for seven days, distributing porridge and honey to the monks.  On the eighth day, when Tissa went for alms in Sāvatthi, he received one thousand bowls of alms and one thousand pieces of cloth, all of which he gave to the monks.  This earned for him the name of Pindapātadāyaka.  One day, in the cold season, he saw monks warming themselves before fires and, discovering that they had no blankets, he, accompanied by one thousand monks, went into the city.  Wherever he went people gave him blankets; one shopkeeper had hidden two of his very costly blankets, but on seeing Tissa he gave them willingly.  Tissa thus got one thousand blankets and was thereafter called Kambaladāyaka.[/p][p]Having discovered that, at Jetavana, his young relations came too often to see him, he obtained a formula of meditation and went into the forest to a distance of twenty leagues from Sāvatthi.  At the request of the inhabitants of the village near by, he spent the rainy season in the forest hermitage, going into the village for alms.  There, at the end of two months, he attained arahantship.  Because he was so devoted to the forest, he was given the name of Vanavāsī.  At the end of the vassa, all the Buddha's chief disciples, with a retinue of forty thousand monks, visited Tissa in his hermitage, arriving there in the evening.  The villagers, recognizing Sāriputta, asked him to preach the Dhamma, saying that Tissa, their teacher, knew only two sentences "May you be happy, may you obtain release from suffering!" which sentences he repeated whenever anyone made him a gift.  Thereupon Sāriputta asked him to explain the meaning of the two sentences, and the novice preached till sunrise, summarizing the whole of the Buddha's teaching “even as a thunderstorm rains incessantly upon the four great continents."[/p][p]At the end of the discourse Tissa's supporters were divided into two camps, some were offended that he should not have preached to them before, while others marvelled at his saintliness and skill.  The Buddha, aware of this disagreement, went himself to the village.  The villagers gave alms to the Buddha and the monks, and, in returning thanks, the Buddha told them how fortunate they were that, owing to Tissa, they had been able to see himself and his chief disciples.  They were then all satisfied.[/p][p]On the way back to Sāvatthi, Tissa walked beside the Buddha and pointed out to him the various beautiful spots.  The Buddha preached the Upasālhaka Jātaka to show that there was no spot on earth where men had not at some time died.  In answer to a question of the Buddha, Tissa said that he never felt afraid of the animals in the forest, but only a greater love for the forest at the sound of their voices.  He then recited fifty stanzas in praise of life in the wilds.  Arrived at the outskirts of the forest, he took leave of the Buddha and Sāriputta and returned to live in his forest hermitage.  DhA.ii.84-102. The visit of Buddha is also reported at DA.i.240 and MA.i.357, though the details are the different.  There the Buddha is accompanied by Sāriputta and the chief disciples and twenty thousand arahants.[/p][hr][p][b]2.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Vātamiga Jātaka (No.  14)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta was once born as Brahmadatta, king of Benares.  He had a gardener named Sañjaya.  A vātamiga used to visit the royal park, and the king asked Sañjaya to catch it.  Sañjaya put honey on the grass where the animal fed, and, in due course, the animal came to eat out of his hand.  He was thus able to entice it right into the palace, where he shut the door on it.  The king marvelled that a vātamiga, who was so shy that if it once saw a man it would not visit the same place for a week after, should allow itself to be caught by greed.[/p][p]The story was related in reference to Cullapindapātika Tissa (q.v.), who was enticed back to the lay life by a slave girl.  Sañjaya is identified with the slave and the vātamiga with the monk.  J.i.156ff.[/p][p]According to the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iv.199), however, it was with reference to Sundarasamudda that the story was told.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Vakkali [/div][hr][p][b]1. Vakkali Thera.  [/b] He belonged to a brahmin family of Sāvatthi and became proficient in the three Vedas.  After he once saw the Buddha he could never tire of looking at him, and followed him about.  In order to be closer to him he became a monk, and spent all his time, apart from meals and bathing, in contemplating the Buddha's person.  One day the Buddha said to him, "The sight of my foul body is useless; he who sees the Dhamma, he it is that seeth me" (yo kho dhammam passati so mam passati; yo mam passati so dhammam passati) (Cp.  Itv.  sec.  92).  But even then Vakkali would not leave the Buddha till, on the last day of the rains, the Buddha commanded him to depart.  Greatly grieved, Vakkali sought the precipices of Gijjhakūta.  The Buddha, aware of this, appeared before him and uttered a stanza; then stretching out his hand, he said: "Come, monk." Filled with joy, Vakkali rose in the air pondering on the Buddha's words and realized arahantship.  AA.i.140f.; the Apadāna account (Ap.ii.465f.) is similar.  It says that the Buddha spoke to him from the foot of the rock.  Vakkali jumped down to meet the Buddha, a depth of many cubits, but he alighted unhurt.  It was on this occasion that the Buddha declared his eminence among those of implicit faith; also DhA.iv.118f.  The DhA.  reports three verses uttered by the Buddha in which he assures Vakkali that he will help him and look after him.[/p][p]According to the Theragāthā, Commentary (ThagA.i.420), when Vakkali was dismissed by the Buddha he lived on Gijjhakūta, practising meditation, but could not attain insight because of his emotional nature (saddhā).  The Buddha then gave him a special exercise, but neither could he achieve this, and, from lack of food, he suffered from cramp.  The Buddha visited him and uttered a verse to encourage him.  Vakkali spoke four verses (Thag.350 4) in reply, and, conjuring up insight, won arahantship.  Later, in the assembly of the monks, the Buddha declared him foremost among those of implicit faith (saddhādhimuttānam) (cp.  A.i.25; also Dvy.49 and VibhA.276; Vsm.i.129).  In the Pārāyanavagga (SN.  vs.  1146) the Buddha is represented as holding Vakkali up to Pingiya as an example of one who won emancipation through faith.[/p][p]The Samyutta account (S.iii.119ff.; SA.ii.229) gives more details and differs in some respects from the above.  There, Vakkali fell ill while on his way to visit the Buddha at Rājagaha, and was carried in a litter to a potter's shed in Rājagaha.  There, at his request, the Buddha visited him and comforted him.  He questioned Vakkali, who assured him that he had no cause to reprove himself with regard to morals (sīlato); his only worry was that he had not been able to see the Buddha earlier.  The Buddha told him that seeing the Dhamma was equivalent to seeing him, and because Vakkali had realized the Dhamma, there would be no hereafter for him.  After the Buddha had left, Vakkali asked his attendants to take him to Kālasilā on Isigili.  The Buddha was on Gijjhakūta and was told by two devas that Vakkali was about to "obtain release." The Buddha sent word to him: "Fear not, Vakkali, your dying will not be evil." Vakkali rose from his bed to receive the Buddha's message, and sending word to the Buddha that he had no desire or love for the body or the other khandhas, he drew a knife and killed himself.  The Buddha went to see his body, and declared that he had obtained Nibbāna and that Māra's attempt to find the consciousness of Vakkali would prove useless.[/p][p]The Commentary adds that Vakkali was conceited and blind to his remaining faults.  He thought he was a khīnāsava, and that he might rid himself of bodily pains by death.  However, the stab with the knife caused him such pain that at the moment of dying he realized his puthujjana state, and, putting forth great effort, attained arahantship.[/p][p]His resolve to become chief among the saddhādhimuttas had been made in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, when he saw a monk also named Vakkali similarly honoured by the Buddha.

Vajirā answers that there is no such thing as “being," apart from certain conditioned factors, like a chariot, which exists only because of its parts.

[/p][p]The Buddha replied that the brahmin knew neither the meaning of vasala, nor what makes a man such.  At the request of the brahmin he preached this sutta, the burden of which is that it is not by birth that one is an outcaste or a brahmana, but by one's deeds (SN., pp.  21f).

Dabba repudiated the charge, and the Buddha ordered the monks to proclaim the pattanikkujjana on Vaddha.  When Ananda visited Vaddha and told him this news he fell in a faint, and, later, visited the Buddha with his family to ask for forgiveness.  He was ordered to go before the Sangha and confess his error, after which the sentence was revoked.  Vin.ii.124ff.[/p][p]He is probably identical with Vaddhamāna Thera (q.v.).[/p][hr][p][b]2.

Vaddha became a monk under Veludatta and developed into an eloquent preacher.  One day he visited his mother alone and without his cloak, and was rebuked by her.  Agitated by this, he returned to his monastery, and, during his siesta, developed insight, attaining arahantship.  ThagA.i.413f.  Six of his verses appear in Thag.335-9; ep.  Thig.210-12.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Vangīsa Thera[/div][p]He belonged to a brahmin family and was proficient in the Vedas.  He gained repute by tapping on skulls with his finger nail and telling thereby where the owners of the skull were reborn.  During three years he thus gained much money.  Then, in spite of the protests of his colleagues, he went to see the Buddha, who gave him the skull of an arahant (according to the Apadāna, he saw Sāriputta first and learnt from him about the Buddha).  Vangīsa could make nothing of this and joined the Order to learn its secret.  He was ordained by Nigrodhakappa, and, meditating on the thirty two constituents of the body, he won arahantship.  He then visited the Buddha again and praised him in various verses, full of similes and metaphors.  This brought him reputation as a poet (Kāvyacitta or Kāveyyamatta).  Later the Buddha declared him foremost among those pre eminent in ready expression (patibhānavantānam).  His resolve to attain to this position was made in the time of Padumuttara Buddha.  A.i.24; Dpv.iv.4; ThagA.ii.192ff.; AA.i.149ff.; DhA.iv.226f.; SNA.i.345f.; Ap.ii.495ff.[/p][p]The Theragāthā contains numerous verses spoken by him on various occasions (Thag.1208 79; most of these are repeated at S.i.183ff ) some of them (1209-18) uttered about himself, his attempts to suppress desires excited by the sight of gaily dressed women (Cf.  S.i.185; on one such occasion, he confessed his disaffection to Ananda, who admonished him.); others (1219-22) were self admonitions against conceit because of his facility of speech; some were spoken in praise of sermons preached by the Buddha - e.g., the Subhāsita Sutta (1227-30), a sutta on Nibbāna (1238-45), and a sutta preached at the Pavārana ceremony (1231-7).  Several verses were in praise of his colleagues - e.g.  Sāriputta (1231-3), Aññā Kondañña (1246-8), and Moggallāna (1249-51).  One of Vangīsa's long poems (vvs.  1263-74) is addressed to the Buddha, questioning him as to the destiny of his (Vangīsa's) teacher Nigrodhakappa.  The Commentary (ThagA.ii.211) explains that when Nigrodhakappa died Vangīsa was absent and wished to be assured by the Buddha that his teacher had reached Nibbāna.  But the poem is more than a question.  It is really a eulogy of the Buddha.  Another verse (1252) describes the Buddha as he sat surrounded by his monks on the banks of the Gaggarā at Campā.[/p][p]The Samyutta (S.i.185ff.; SA.i.207ff ) devotes one whole section to Vangīsa, dealing with the incidents connected with his life and giving poems made by him on these occasions.  The Milinda (p.  390)'also contains a poem attributed to Vangīsa in praise of the Buddha.  According to the Apadāna (Ap.ii.497, vs.27), he was called Vangīsa, both because he was born in Vanga and also because he was master of the spoken word (vacana).

His name was Vaccha; but because of his love for the woods, he was called Vanavaccha.  He left the world soon after the Buddha's Renunciation, and led the ascetic life till he heard of the Buddha's Enlightenment.  Then he joined the Order, and it was in the forest that he strove and won arahantship.  When he returned to Kapilavatthu with the Buddha, his companions asked him why he so loved the forest, and he spoke a verse in praise of forest life (Thag.13).[/p][p]In the time of Atthadassī Buddha, he was a large tortoise living in the Vinatā.  Seeing the Buddha about to cross the river, he took him on his back.  Many hundreds of times afterwards he lived as an ascetic in the forest.  In the time of Kassapa Buddha he became a dove, and his heart was gladdened by the sight of a monk practicing compassion.  Later he was born as a householder in Benares and renounced the world.

Soon after, he attained arahantship and, devoted to detachment, dwelt in the woods hence his name.  When he went to Rājagaha his kinsmen asked him to live near them, but he said he preferred the lonely life of the forest (Thag.113).[/p][p]In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a labourer, and, having committed a crime, while fleeing from justice he saw a Bodhi tree.  Pleased with the look of the tree, he gathered masses of asoka flowers and heaped them up round the tree.  When his pursuers reached him, he remained as he was, looking at them, with no hatred in his heart.  They hurled him into a precipice, and he died with the thought of the Bodhi tree in his heart.  Three kappas ago he was a king named Santusita (ThagA.i.222).  He is perhaps identical with Tambapupphiya of the Apadāna.  Ap.i.176.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Vaddhakisūkara Jātaka (No.  283)[/div][p]A carpenter of a village near Benares was once wandering in the forest, and having found a young boar in a pit, took him home and brought him up.  The boar was well mannered and helped the carpenter in his work, and so he came to be called Vaddhakisūkara ("Carpenter boar").  When he grew up, the carpenter took him back to the forest, and there he came across some boars who lived in mortal fear of a tiger.  The young boar drilled his army of boars, arranged them in battle array, and awaited the tiger.  When he arrived, the boars, under their leader's instructions, mimicked the tiger in all he did.  The tiger, thereupon, sought the advice of a false ascetic who shared his prey, and, following his counsel, made a leap at the boar leader and fell into a pit which had been dug for him.  There the boars attacked him and ate him, and those who were unable to get any of the flesh sniffed at the others' mouths to see how "tiger" tasted.  Then they set off after the false ascetic, and when he climbed a fig tree they dug it up and it fell to the ground.  The man was torn to pieces and his body licked clean.  The boars then placed their leader on the tree trunk, consecrated him king with water, which they fetched in the dead man's skull, and made a young sow his consort.  (This is how kings came to be consecrated with water from shells and seated on a throne of fig planks.) The Bodhisatta who was then a tree sprite sang the boar's praises.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to Dhanuggahatissa (q.v.), who was responsible for Pasenadi's victory over Ajātasattu.

Vāsuladatta assumed a huge Nāga form, three hundred leagues long, with a head one league in extent, and having swallowed the casket containing the relics, lay down at the foot of Sineru.

Distressed by the sight of their hatred for each other, he sought the help of the Buddha, who preached to him three stanzas (Thag.237-9).  At the end of the recitation, Vārana developed insight and became an arahant.

He was told that Udena could charm elephants with his magic lute, and had a wooden elephant made in which he placed sixty men.  A woodsman was sent to inform Udena of the new elephant which had appeared in the forest, and he set out to capture it.  The men inside the elephant caused it to run, and, in the course of the chase, Udena was separated from his retinue and taken captive.  [/p][p]For three days Pajjota feasted in celebration of his victory, and Udena asked him either to release him or order his death.  Pajjota promised release if Udena would teach him the elephant charm; but Udena would teach only to one who paid him homage as a teacher, and this Pajjota would not do.  Then Pajjota contrived that Udena should teach it to Vāsuladattā.  A curtain was hung between them, Udena was told that his pupil was a hunch backed woman of the court, while Udena was described to the princess as a leper who knew a priceless charm.  [/p][p]For many days Udena tried to teach the charm, but the princess could not learn it.  In impatience, Udena said: "Dunce of a hunchback, thy lips are too thick and thy cheeks too fat; I've a mind to beat thy face in." And the princess replied: "Villain of a leper, what meanest thou by calling me hunchback?" Udena lifted the fringe of the curtain and they saw each other.  From that moment they planned to escape and marry.  There was no more learning of charms nor giving of lessons.  When their plans were complete, Vāsuladattā told her father that she needed a conveyance and the use of a gate in the city wall.  To work the charm, she explained, a certain herb was necessary, which must be obtained at night, at a time indicated by the stars.  Thus she secured the use of Pajjota's female elephant, Bhaddavatī, and permission to use a certain door at any time.  [/p][p]And one day, when Pajjota was out on pleasure, the two filled several bags with gold and silver coins and they started off on Bhaddavatī.  The harem guards gave the alarm and the king sent men in pursuit.  Udena opened first a sack of gold and then one of silver, scattering the coins, which delayed his pursuers, greedy for the coins.  He, meanwhile, hurried on and reached the stockade where his soldiers awaited him.  They conducted him and Vāsuladattā, to Kosambī, where she was made Udena's chief consort.

Bimbisāra later built huts for them, but he forgot to roof them, and so there was no rain till the roofs were added.[/p][p]In the time of Siddhattha Buddha, Valliya offered him a handful of flowers.

[/b] He was the son of an eminent brahmin of Sāvatthi, and, owing to his good friends, he met the Buddha and joined the Order, soon after attaining arahantship.  Thirty one kappas ago he saw the Pacceka Buddha Nārada at the foot of a tree, and built for him a hut of reeds, which he thatched with grass, together with a cloistered walk strewn with sand.  He was seventy one times king of the devas and thirty four times king of men.  ThagA.i.247; two verses in the Thag.  (125-6) are attributed to him.[/p][p]He is probably identical with Nalāgārika of the Apadāna.  Ap.i.278f.[/p][hr][p][b]3. Valliya Thera.[/b] He belonged to a brahmin family of Vesāli, and was named Gandimitta (v.l.  Kanhamitta).  Much struck by the Buddha when he came to Vesāli, he joined the Order under Mahā Kaccāyana.  Because he was dull of insight and depended too much on his colleagues, he was called Valliya (creeper), like the ivy which must lean on something in order to grow.  Later, following the advice of Venudatta Thera, he developed insight.[/p][p]In the time of Sumedha Buddha he was a rich brahmin, well versed in learning.  Later, he renounced eighty crores of wealth, and, after becoming an ascetic, lived on a river bank.  There the Buddha visited him, and, seated on an antelope skin, preached the Doctrine.  The ascetic paid him great honour and gave him mangoes and perfume and flowers.[/p][p]In the Apadāna verses, quoted in ThagA., it is said that Valliya was born in the city of Vebhāra, built by Vissakamma, and that he left the household at the age of five.  ThagA.i.292f.; two verses addressed by him to Venudatta are included in the Thag.  (167-8).[/p][p]He is probably identical with Candanamāliya of the Apadāna.  Ap.ii.423f.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Vajjiputta Thera[/div][hr][p][b]1. Vajjiputta Thera.[/b] He belonged to the family of a minister of Vesāli, and, seeing the majesty of the Buddha who visited the city, he joined the Order and lived in a wood near by.  A festival took place in Vesāli, with much singing and dancing and gaiety.  This distracted Vajjiputta, and he expressed his disgust in a verse spoken in scorn of the forest life.  A woodland sprite heard him and upbraided him, saying, "Though you spurn life in the forest, the wise, desiring solitude, think much of it," and she then uttered a verse praising it.  This verse, which the monk afterwards repeated, is included in Thag.vs.62. [/p][p]Urged on by the sprite's words, Vajjiputta developed insight and became an arahant.[/p][p]Ninety one kappas ago he had been a householder and had paid homage to Vipassī Buddha, with pollen from nāga flowers.  Forty five kappas ago he was a king, named Renu.  ThagA.i.142f.  Vajjiputta's story is given very briefly in S.i.201f.[/p][p]Vajjiputta's story is also given in the Dhammapada Commentary.  There he is called a rājā, and is said to have renounced his kingdom when his turn came to rule.  On the day of the festival, on the full moon day of Kattika, he was filled with discontent.  After his conversation with the woodland sprite, he sought the Buddha, who preached to him.  He attained arahantship at the end of the Buddha's sermon.  DhA.iii.460f.; see also SA.i.228, where also he is called rājā.  There may be some confusion between Vajjiputta (1) and (2).[/p][p]He is evidently to be identified with Renupūjaka of the Apadāna.  Ap.i.146.[/p][hr][p][b]2. Vajjiputta Thera.[/b] He belonged to a Licchavi rājā's family, and while still young, and learning various arts, such as training elephants, he was filled with the desire for renunciation.  One day he went to a vihāra where the Buddha was preaching, entered the Order, and not long after became an arahant.[/p][p]After the Buddha's death, when the chief Elders were living in various places prior to their agreed meeting for the recital of the Dhamma, he saw Ananda, still a learner (sekha), teaching the Doctrine to a large assembly.  Wishing to urge him to higher attainment, Vajjiputta uttered a verse, and this verse was among those which led to Ananda's attainment of arahantship.  The verse is found in Thag.vs.119. In S.i.199 the verse is attributed to a forest deva who wished to agitate Ananda.  In Rockhill (op.  cit., 155f.), Vajjiputta was Ananda's attendant at the time and preached to the people while Ananda meditated.[/p][p]Ninety four kappas ago, Vajjiputta had seen a Pacceka Buddha begging for alms and had given him plantain fruits.

Vappa was with the Buddha during the six years of his ascetic practices, but being disappointed when the Buddha began taking solid food, he left him and went to Isipatana, where the Buddha, after his Enlightenment, preached to him and the others the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta.

Kammahārattaka).[/p][p]He married Anulā, wife of Khallātanāga, and adopted Mahācūlika as his own son; because of this Vattagāmanī came to be known as Pitirājā (this name occurs several times in the Commentaries - e.g., VibhA.  passim, see Pitirājā).  [/p][p]Vattagāmanī had a second wife, Somadevī, and also a son of his own, called Coranāga.  In the fifth month of his reign a brahmin, named Tissa, rose against him, but was defeated by seven Damilas who landed at Mahātittha.  .  After that, the Damilas waged war against the king and defeated him at Kolambālaka.  It was a remark made by the Nigantha Giri to Vattagāmainī, as he fled from the battle, that led later to the establishment of Abhayagiri (q.v.).  The king hid in the forest in Vessagiri and was rescued by Kupikkala Mahātissa, who gave him over to the care of Tanasīva.  In his flight he left Somadevī behind, and she was captured by the Damilas.  [/p][p]For fourteen years Vattagāmanī and his queen Anulā lived under the protection of Tanasīva, and, during this time, five Damilas ruled in succession at Anurādhapura; they were Pulahattha, Bāhiya, Panayamāra, Pilayamāra and Dāthika.  [/p][p]After a time, Anulā quarrelled with Tanasīva's wife, and the king, in his resentment, killed Tanasīva.  Later, when he also killed Kapisīsa, his ministers left him in disgust, but were persuaded by Mahātissa to return.  When his preparations were complete, the king attacked Dāthika, slew him, and took the throne.  He then founded Abhayagiri-vihāra and recovered Somadevī.  He also built the Silāsobbhakandaka-cetiya.  He had seven ministers who themselves built several vihāras; among them Uttiya, Mūla, Sāliya, Pabbata and Tissa are mentioned by name.  [/p][p]It was in the reign of Vattagāmanī that the Buddhist Canon and its Commentaries were first reduced to writing in Ceylon, according to tradition, in Aloka vihāra.  For details of Vattagāmanī's reign see Dpv.xx.14ff.; Mhv.xxxiii.34ff.  The foundation of Abhayagiri vihāra formed the beginning of dissensions in the ranks of the monks (Cv.lxxiii.18).  Vattagāmani was, however, regarded by later generations as a great protector of the faith (Cv.lxxxii.23).  Various monasteries, chiefly rock temples, are traditionally ascribed to Vattagāmanī, and said to have been built by him during his exile; among these is the modern Dambulla vihāra.  The Cūlavamsa calls him the founder of the Majjhavela vihāra.  Cv.c.229.[/p]</e>

The Buddha, in answer, says that a bad man cannot, as a good man can, recognize either a good man or a bad man as such.  Vassakāra then relates how, once, the followers of the brahmin Todeyya spoke ill of Eleyya and his retinue for showing homage to Rāmaputta; he now understands why they honour Rāmaputta; it is because he is wiser than they.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Valāhassa Jātaka (No.  196)[/div][p]Once, in Tambannidīpa, was a Yakkha-city called Sirīsavatthu, peopled by Yakkhinīs.

On the arrival of other castaways, they would eat their former husbands and take the new arrivals as their lovers.  Once five hundred merchants were cast ashore there and became the husbands of the yakkhinīs.  In the night the yakkhinīs left them and ate their former husbands.  The eldest merchant discovered this and warned the others, but only half of them were willing to attempt an escape.  Now it happened that the Bodhisatta was a horse of the Valāhaka race and was flying through the air from the Himālaya to Tambapanni.  There, as he passed over the banks and fields, he asked in a human voice: "Who wants to go home?" and the two hundred and fifty traders begged to be taken.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Vacchagotta[/div][hr][p][b]1. Vacchagotta.  [/b] A Paribbājaka, who later became an arahant Thera.  Several conversations he had with the Buddha are mentioned in the books.  For details see the Tevijja Vacchagotta-, Aggi Vacchagotta-, Mahā Vacchagotta-, Vaccha- and Vacchagotta-Suttas.  Some of these suttas are quoted in the Kathāvatthu (E.g., p.  267, 505).  The Samyutta Nikāya contains a whole section on Vacchagotta; his discussions were chiefly concerned with such mythical questions as to whether the world is eternal, the nature of life, the existence or otherwise of the Tathāgata after death, etc.  S.iii.257ff.; see also S.iv.391ff., for several discussions of Vacchagotta with Moggallāna, Ananda and Sabhiya Kaccāna on similar topics.  The three Vacchagotta Suttas of the Majjhima Nikāya seem to contain the story of Vacchagotta's conversion, in due order: at the conclusion of the Tevijja Vacchagotta (No.  72) it is merely stated that "the Paribbājaka Vacchagotta rejoiced in what the Blessed One has said." At the end of the next, the Aggi Vacchagotta, he is mentioned as having accepted the Buddha as his teacher.  In the third, the Mahā Vacchagotta, he seeks ordination from the Buddha at Rājagaha, and receives it after the requisite probationary period of four months.  He returns to the Buddha after two weeks and tells him that he has attained all that is to be attained by a non arahant's understanding and asks for a further exposition of the Doctrine.  The Buddha tells him to proceed to the study of calm and insight, whereby sixfold abhiññā may be acquired.  Vacchagotta profits by the lesson and soon after becomes an arahant.  He thereupon sends news of his attainment to the Buddha through some monks, and the Buddha says he has already heard the news from the devas (M.i.493 97).[/p][p]This story definitely identifies the Paribbājaka with the Thera of the same name, whose verse of ecstasy is included in the Theragāthā (vs.  112).  According to the Commentary (ThagA.i.221), he belonged to a rich brahmin family of the Vaccha clan (Vacchagotta).  His personal name is not given.  He became an expert in brahmin learning, but failing to find therein what he sought, he became a Paribbājaka, joining the Buddha's Order later.[/p][p]In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a householder of Bandhumatī, and one day, when the Buddha and his monks were invited to the king's palace, he swept the street along which the Buddha passed and set up a Rag as decoration.  As a result he was born, four kappas ago, as a rājā, Sudhaja by name.  He is probably identical with Vīthisammajjaka of the Apadāna.  Ap.i.177.[/p][hr][p][b]2. Vacchagotta.[/b] A Paribbājaka.  He is mentioned in the Anguttara Nikāva (A.i.180f ) as visiting the Buddha at Venāgapura, where he was at the head of the brahmins.  He is possibly to be identified with Vacchagotta (1).  In this context, however, he is called Venāgapurika.  Vacchagotta (1) (q.v.) was a native of Rājagaha, but seems to have travelled widely, for we find him visiting the Buddha at Vesāli (M.i.481), at Sāvatthi (M.i.483; S.iii.257), and at Ñātikā (S.iv.  401), in addition to his visits to Rājagaha (M.i.489).  The Commentary (AA.i.410), moreover, explains Venāgapuraka by "Venāgapuravāsī," which may mean that he merely lived at Venāgapura and was not necessarily a native of that place.  Vacchagotta's question was as to how the Buddha looked so shining and his colour so clear? Was it because he slept on a luxurious bed? The Buddha answered that his bed was luxurious and comfortable, but from quite a different point of view.  At the end of the discourse, Vacchagotta declares himself a follower of the Buddha.[/p][hr][p][b]3. Vacchagotta.[/b] A brahmin of Kapilavatthu, father of Vanavaccha Thera (q.v.).  ThagA.i.58.[/p]</e>

But the general's wife, Potthā, gave her husband betel without lime to take with him, and, on the way to the palace, Vasabha was sent back to fetch the lime.  There Potthā told him of the plot against his life, gave him one thousand pieces and helped him to escape.  When his plans were ready, he fought against Subha, killed both him and his uncle in battle and became king.  Potthā was made his queen.  Soothsayers told him that he would live only twelve years, and, after consultation with the monks, Vasabha did many acts of merit in order to prolong his life; he reigned for forty four years.  Among the buildings erected by him were the Mahāvalligotta vihāra, the Anurārāma vihāra and the Mucela vihāra.  He also built twelve tanks and raised the wall of Anurādhapura.  His son and successor was Vankannāsikattissa.  For details of Vasabha's reign and works, see Dpv.xxii.1ff.  and Mhv.xxxv.59ff[/p][p]It is said (DA.ii.635) that once Vasabha listened to Dīghabhānaka monks reciting the Mahāsudassana Sutta in the Ambalatthika pāsāda, near Lohapāsāda, and applauded the Buddha's statement contained in the sutta that all things are transient.  On another occasion he went to the Katthakasālaparivena to worship an Elder named Mahāsatthivassa (this may be only a descriptive title), but as he approached the door of his cell, he heard the Elder's groans of pain, and, disappointed that he had not yet developed the power of suppressing pain even after sixty years of monastic life, the king turned away.  The Elder was told of this by his attendant, and, putting forth great effort, attained arahantship; he thereupon sent for the king.  The king lay at full length on the ground and worshipped him, saying, "It is not your arahantship I worship, but the Sīla you observed as a puthujjana." (DA.i.291)[/p][p]Another story is related of Vasabha, of how once, in order to test a monk, he sat near him and began to crush a jujube fruit.  The monk's mouth watered, and Vasabha knew that he was not an Arahant (MA.ii.869).[/p][p]Once when Vasabha's queen was ill, she was cured by medicines suggested by Mahāpaduma Thera.

According to the Apadāna verses quoted, he was born in Sāvatthi and was ordained under Sāriputta at the age of seven.  Out of compassion for his patrons, he enjoyed what he received from them; the common minded thereupon deemed him self indulgent.  Near him lived a fraudulent monk who deceived the people by pretending to live the simple life and was greatly honoured by them.  Sakka, discerning this, visited Vasabha and questioned him concerning the ways of an impostor.  The Elder replied in two verses (Thag.139 40), and Sakka then warned the impostor and departed.[/p][p]In the past, when the world was without a Buddha, Vasabha was a Jatila named Nārada on Samaggapabbata, with a retinue of fourteen thousand.  Seeing no one deserving of his worship, he made a cetiya of sand on the bank of the River Apadikā, in the name of the Buddhas, gilded it and offered it his homage.  Eighty times he was king of devas and three hundred times king of men (ThagA.i.257ff).  He is evidently to be identified with Pulinathūpiya of the Apadāna.  Ap.ii.437f.[/p][hr][p][b]6.

Kākavannatissa heard of this and summoned him to the court.  The village irrigated by the tank was given to him, and it came to be called Vasabhodakavāra.  Mhv.xxiii.90ff.[/p][hr][p][b]7.

AA.ii.705ff).[/p][p]At Ajātasattu's suggestion, Vassakāra visited the Buddha to discover, indirectly, whether, in the Buddha's view, there were any chances of Ajātasattu conquering the Vajjians in battle.  The Buddha said that as long as the Vajjians practised the seven conditions of prosperity which he had taught them at Sārandada cetiya, they would prosper rather than decline, and this gave Vassakāra the idea that the downfall of the Vajjians could be brought about by diplomacy (upalāpana) or disunion (mithubheda).  He thereupon conspired with the king (D.A.ii.522ff ) and, by agreement, the latter expelled him on the charge of showing favour to the Vajjians during discussions in the assembly.  Vassakāra then went to the Vajjian country, and the Licchavis, all unsuspecting, welcomed him and appointed him as the teacher of their children.  By means of cunning and questioning the children in secret, he made them quarrel with each other, and these quarrels soon spread to the elders.  In three years the Licchavis were completely disunited, and when the assembly drum was beaten, they failed to appear.  Vassakāra then sent a message to Ajātasattu, who was able to capture Vesāli without meeting any resistance.[/p][p]In the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gopaka_mogga,Gopaka Moggallāna Sutta')"]Gopaka Moggallāna Sutta[/a] (M.iii.8ff), Vassakāra is represented as arriving in the middle of a conversation, which Gopaka Moggallāna was holding with Ananda, having been sent to inspect the works at Rājagaha, which were in charge of Moggallāna.  Having asked the subject of conversation, he inquired whether the Buddha himself or the Order had chosen a leader for the Sangha after the Buddha's death.  Ananda explains that the Buddha did not do so, that no special leader has been appointed, but that there were monks to whom they showed honour and reverence because of their virtue and insight.  Vassakāra admits this as good, as does also Upananda, the Senāpati, who is present.  Vassakāra asks Ananda where he lives, and is told, in  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/veluvana,Veluvana')"]Veluvana[/a].  Vassakāra thinks this a good place for the practice of jhāna, and tells Ananda of a conversation he once had with the Buddha regarding jhāna.  Ananda, remarks that all jhānas are not equally praiseworthy, and Vassakāra takes his leave.[/p][p]Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.854) that Vassakāra knew well of Ananda's residence at Veluvana, but that as the place was under his special protection, he wished to hear his work praised.

The Buddha, hearing of this, said that, unless Vassakāra begged the Elder's forgiveness, he would be born as a monkey in Veluvana.  Vassakāra, feeling sure that the Buddha's prophecy would come true, had various fruit and other trees planted in Veluvana, to be of use to him as a monkey.  After death he was actually reborn as a monkey and answered to the name of Vassakāra.[/p][p]Three conversations between the Buddha and Vassakāra are recorded in the Anguttara Nikāya, all three taking place at Veluvana.  See  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vassakaara_sutta,Vassakāra Suttas')"]Vassakāra Suttas[/a] (1) and (2), and Suta Sutta ??.

So the crocodile lay on the rock, ready to catch the monkey as he jumped.  The monkey noticing that, in spite of there being no tide, the rock was higher than usual, spoke to it and received no reply.  His suspicions were then confirmed, and he said again, "O rock, why don't you talk to me today ?" The crocodile then revealed both his identity and his purpose, and the monkey resolved to outwit him.  So he asked him to open his mouth, knowing that when a crocodile does this he shuts his eyes.

Once, when on his way to see the Buddha at Gaggarā Lake, he found he had arrived too early and went into the Paribbājakārāma near by.  The Paribbājakas asked him if it was true that the Buddha ridicules all forms of asceticism and austerity.  They spoke of the Buddha as a teacher of a discipline which he himself did not follow, a nihilist (venayika) and a visionary (? appaññattika).  (For explanation of these terms, see AA.ii.854).  Vajjiyamāhita refuted their arguments, maintaining that the Buddha declared what was good and what was bad, and that the truth of his teachings could be proved.  Having thus silenced them, he sought the Buddha, to whom he repeated the conversation.  The Buddha praised him, and said it was untrue that he discouraged all austerity and asceticism; such penances as led to the destruction of evil states and the promotion of good states, he welcomed and encouraged.  When Vajjiyamāhita had left him, the Buddha held him up to the monks as an example of a good householder, capable of profitable discussion with followers of other persuasions.

Seeing no means of escape, he made an Act of Truth (sacca-kiriyā), calling to mind the holiness of the Buddhas and their doctrines.  The fire retreated to a distance of sixteen lengths and then extinguished itself.  The story was related in reference to a fire which broke out in the jungle when the Buddha was travelling in Magadha with a large company of monks.  Some of the monks were frightened and suggested various methods for putting out the fire, while others said they should seek the Buddha's protection.  This they did and the Buddha took them to a certain spot, where he halted.  The flames came no nearer than sixteen lengths from where they were standing, and in approaching the spot extinguished themselves.  When the monks marvelled at the great power of the Buddha, he told them the story of the past and said that, owing to his Act of Truth as a quail, that spot would never be harmed by flames during the whole of this kappa.

He had descended from the Brahma world and had no desire for women.  Once, during the Kattika festival, his friends sent him a gaily decked woman to entice him, but he gave her some money and sent her away.  As she came out of his house, a nobleman saw her and took her with him.  When she failed to return, her mother complained to the king, and the setthiputta was told to restore her.  On failing to do so, he was taken off for execution.  He resolved that if by any means he could escape execution he would become a monk.

Bhāradvāja protested, whereupon Māgandiya offered to repeat his charge to the Buddha's face.  The Buddha, aware of this conversation, entered the hut in the evening and had a discussion with Māgandiya, who ended by joining the Order, later becoming an arahant.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Māgandiyā[/div][p]Daughter of the brahmin  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maagandiya,Māgandiya')"]Māgandiya[/a].  When the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"]Buddha[/a] rejected her father's offer of marriage with her, her parents joined the Order, giving her in charge of her uncle, Culla Māgandiya.  The latter took her to  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udena,Udena')"]Udena[/a], king of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambii,Kosambī')"]Kosambī[/a], who made her his chief consort, giving her five hundred ladies in waiting.  Māgandiyā was incensed against the Buddha for having called her a "vessel of filth," and, when he came to Kosambī, she planned her revenge.  Having discovered that Udena's other queen,  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/samavati,Sāmāvatī')"]Sāmāvatī[/a], and her companions were in the habit of watching for the Buddha through windows in the walls of their rooms, she told the king that Sāmāvatī and her friends were conspiring to kill him.  For some time the king refused to believe this, but when the holes were shown to him, he had them closed up and the windows built higher.[/p][p]This plan having failed, Māgandiyā hired a slave to revile and abuse the Buddha in the streets.   [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda,Ananda')"]Ananda[/a] suggested to the Buddha that they should go elsewhere.  The Buddha answered, "I am like the elephant who has entered the fray, I must endure the darts that come upon me.  After seven days the abuse ceased.  Māgandiyā then persuaded her uncle to send eight live cocks to the palace and sent a page with them to the king's drinking place.  When the king asked what should be done with them, she suggested that Sāmāvatī and her friends should be asked to cook them for him.  This the king agreed to do, but the women refused to deprive an animal of its life.  Māgandiyā said they should be tested, and sent word by the page that the cocks were to be cooked for the Buddha.  The page was bribed to change the live cocks for dead ones on the way, and Sāmāvatī and her companions then cooked them and sent them to the Buddha.  But even then the king, though not knowing of the exchange, would not be convinced of Sāmāvatī's disloyalty.[/p][p]Māgandiyā then obtained a snake from her uncle with its fangs removed.  This she inserted in the shell of the flute which Udena carried about, closing the hole with a bunch of flowers.  Udena was in the habit of spending a week in turn with each of his three consorts.  When he announced his intention of going to Sāmāvatī, Māgandiyā begged of him not to go, saying she had had a dream and feared for his safety.  But the king went and Māgandiyā went with him.  As he lay asleep with the lute under his pillow she pulled out the bunch of flowers, and the snake lay coiled on his pillow.  Māgandiyā screamed and accused Sāmāvatī of designs on the king's life.  This time Udena believed her, and placing Sāmāvati and her friends in a line one behind the other, he sent for his bow, which could only be strung by one thousand men, and shot an arrow at Sāmāvatī's breast.  But by the power of her goodness the arrow failed to pierce her.  Convinced of her innocence, the king pleaded for her forgiveness and gave her a boon.  She chose that the Buddha should be invited to come to the palace every day, but the Buddha would not accept the invitation and sent Ananda in his place.[/p][p]Once more Māgandiyā conspired with her uncle against Sāmāvatī.  They had all the pillars of Sāmāvatī's house wrapt in cloth, soaked in oil, and, when she and her women were inside, the house was set fire to.  Sāmāvatī saw the flames spreading and exhorted her women to be self possessed, and they attained to various fruits of the Path.  Udena questioned Māgandiyā very carefully, and became convinced of her share and that of her uncle in the crime.  He then sent for all Māgandiya's relations saying that he wished to reward them.  He buried them waist-deep in the palace grounds and covered them with straw; the straw was then set fire to, and when it was burnt he had their bodies ploughed with an iron plough.  Pieces of flesh were ripped from Māgandiyā's body, fried like cakes in oil, and Māgandiyā was then forced to eat them.  [/p][p]DhA.i.201f., 210ff.; UdA.383f.; cf.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Mātanga Jātaka (No.  497)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta was once born in a Candāla village outside Benares and was named Mātanga.  One day, when Ditthamangalikā, the daughter of a rich merchant, was on her way to the park with a group of friends, she saw Mātanga coming towards the city, and thinking the sight inauspicious, washed her eyes with perfumed water and turned back home.  Her companions, annoyed at being deprived of their fun, beat Mātanga and left him senseless.  On recovering consciousness, he determined to get Ditthamangalikā as wife and lay down outside her father's house refusing to move.  Seven days he lay thus until her relations, fearing the ignominy of having a candāla die at their door, gave Ditthamangalikā to him as wife.[/p][p]Knowing her pride to be quelled by this act, Mātanga decided to bring her great honour.  He, therefore, retired into the forest and in seven days, won supernatural power.  On his return he told her to proclaim abroad that her husband was not a candāla but Mahābrahmā, and that seven days later, on the night of the full moon, he would come to her, breaking through the moon's disk.  She did as he said and so it happened.  The people thenceforth honoured her as a goddess; the water in which she washed her feet was used for the coronation of kings, and in one single day she received eighteen crores from those who were allowed the privilege of saluting her.  Mātanga touched her navel with his thumb, and, knowing that she had conceived a son, admonished her to be vigilant and returned to the moon.[/p][p]The son was born in the pavilion, which the people had constructed for the use of Ditthamangalikā, and was therefore called Mandavya,.  At the age of sixteen he knew all the Vedas and fed sixteen thousand brahmins daily.  On a feast day Mātanga came to him, thinking to turn him from his wrong doctrines, but Mandavya failed to recognize him and had him cast out by his servants, Bhandakucchi, Upajjhāya, and Upajotiya.  The gods of the city thereupon grew angry and twisted the necks of Mandavya and all the brahmins so that their eyes looked over their shoulders.  When Ditthamangalikā heard of this she sought Mātanga, who had left his footsteps so that she might know where he was.  He asked her to sprinkle on the brahmins water in which were dissolved the leavings of his food; to Mandavya himself was given some of the food.  On recovering and seeing the plight of the brahmins, he realized his error.  The brahmins recovered, but were shunned by their colleagues; they left the country and went to live in the kingdom of Mejjha.[/p][p]On the bank of the Vettavatī lived a brahmin called Jātimanta, very proud of his birth.  Mātanga went thither to humble the pride of Jātimanta and lived higher up stream.  One day he nibbled a tooth stick and threw it into the river, where, lower down, it got entangled in Jātimanta's hair.  He was greatly annoyed and went up stream, where he found Mātanga and told him that, if he stayed there any longer, at the end of seven days his head would split into seven pieces.  On the seventh day Mātanga stopped the sun from rising.  On discovering the cause, the people dragged Jātimanta to Mātanga and made him ask forgiveness, falling at Mātanga's feet.  Jātimanta's head was covered with a lump of clay, which was immersed in the water as the sun rose.[/p][p]Mātanga then went to the kingdom of Mejjha, where the exiled brahmins reported against him to the king, saying that he was a juggler and a mountebank.  The king's messengers surprised Mātanga as he was eating his food beside a well, and cut off his head.  He was born in the Brahma world.  The gods were angry and wiped out the whole kingdom of Mejjha by pouring on it torrents of hot ashes.  Before his meeting with Ditthamangalikā the Bodhisatta was a mongoose tamer (kondadamaka).  But in SNA.i.186, he is called a sopākajīvika.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to the attempt of King Udena (q.i) to torture Pindolabhāradvāja.  Udena is identified with Mandavya.

For a slightly different version see DhA.i.264ff.  Because of his birth as Magha, Sakka came to be known as Maghavā.  Maghavā was, perhaps, not the personal name of any particular Sakka, but a title of all Sakkas, because the Sakka who was the real Magha is identified with the Bodhisatta (J.i.207), while the Buddha says (S.i.231; DhA.i.264) that the Sakka, who visited him, and whose conversation is recorded in the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakkapanha_sutta,Sakkapañha Sutta')"]Sakkapañha Sutta[/a], was also known as Maghavā.  The title probably originated from the time when Magha became Sakka.[/p][p]The Samyutta Commentary (SA.i.267; this is supported by the story as given in DA.iii.710 ff.  and DhA.i.264ff., where no mention is made of the Bodhisatta), however, says that Magha was not the Bodhistatta, but that his life was like that of a Bodhisatta (Bodhisattacariyā viyassa cariyā ahosi); in which case the name Maghavā belongs only to the present Sakka.  Magha took upon himself seven vows (vatapadāni), which brought him birth as Sakka: to maintain his parents, to revere his elders, to use gentle language, to utter no slander, to be free from avarice, to practise generosity and open handed liberality and kindness, to speak the truth, to be free from anger (S.i.227f.; SA.i.267).[/p][p]For this and other titles of Sakka, see  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka,Sakka')"]Sakka[/a].[/p]</e>

Its king, soon after the death of Bimbisāra, was Avantiputta (M.ii.83), who, judging by his name, was probably related to the royal family of Ujjeni.  Madhurā was visited by the Buddha (A.ii.57; iii.256), but there is no record of his having stayed there.  In fact, the Madhura Sutta (2) (q.v.) states that he viewed the city with distinct disfavour.  But Mahā Kaccāna evidently liked it, for he stayed there in the Gundāvana, and was visited there by the king of the city, Avantiputta (M.ii.83), and the brahmin Kandarāyana (A.i.67).  One of the most important suttas on caste, the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/madhura_s,Madhura Sutta 1')"]Madhura Sutta 1[/a], was preached to Avantiputta by Mahā Kaccāna at Madhurā.  Perhaps it was through the agency of Mahā Kaccāna that Buddhism gained ground in Madhurā.  Already in the Buddha's time there were, in and around Madhurā, those who accepted his teachings, for the Anguttara Nikāya (A.ii.57) mentions that once when he was journeying from Madhurā to Verañjā and stopped under a tree by the wayside, a large number of householders, both men and women, came and worshipped him.  Later, about 300 B.C., Madhurā became a Jain centre (CHI.i.167), but when Fa Hsien (Giles, p.  20) and Hiouen Thsang visited it, Buddhism was flourishing there, and there were many sanghārāmas and stūpas.  Beal.i.179ff.; for a prophecy (attributed to the Buddha) regarding the future greatness of Madhurā, see Dvy.348ff.[/p][p]From Sankassa to Madhurā was a distance of four yojanas (thus in Kaccāyana's Grammar, iii.1).[/p][p]Madhurā is sometimes referred to as Uttara Madhurā, to distinguish it from a city of the same name in South India.  Thus, in the Vimānavatthu Commentary (VvA.118f), a woman of Uttara Madhurā is mentioned as having been born in Tāvatimsa as a result of having given alms to the Buddha.[/p][p]The Ghata Jātaka (J.iv.79ff) speaks of Mahāsāgara as the king of UttaraMadhurā, and relates what is evidently the story of Kamsa's attempt to tyrannize over Madhurā by overpowering the Yādavas and his consequent death at the hands of Krsna, a story which is found both in the Epics and in the Purānas.  This Jātaka confirms the Brahmanical tradition as to the association of Vasudeva's family with Madhurā (PHAL, p.  89).[/p][p]There is a story (Cv.xcii.23ff ) of a king called Mahāsena of Pātaliputta, who was very generous in feeding the monks, and once thought of giving alms by cultivating a piece of land himself.  He, therefore, went to Uttara Madhurā in disguise, worked as a labourer, and held an almsgiving with the gains so obtained.[/p][p]Madhurā is generally identified with Maholi, five miles to the Southeast of the present town of Mathurā or Muttra.

[/b] A city in South India, in the Madras Presidency, and now known as Madura.  It is generally referred to as Dakkhina-Madhurā, to distinguish it from (Uttara-)Madhura on the Yamunā.  Dakkhina-Madhurā was the second capital of the Pandyan kingdom (their first being Korkai, see Vincent Smith, EHI.335ff), and there was constant intercourse between this city and Ceylon.  From Madhurā came the consort of Vijaya, first king of Ceylon, and she was accompanied by many maidens of various families who settled in Ceylon (Mhv.vii.49ff).  Sena II.  sent an army to pillage Madhurā, and set upon the throne a Pandu prince who had begged for his support (Cv.li.27ff).  Later, Madhurā was attacked by Kulasekhara, and its king, Parakkama, sought the assistance of Parakkamabāhu I.  of Ceylon.  The latter sent an army under his general Lankāpura, but in the meantime the Pāndyan king had been slain and his capital taken.  The Singhalese army, however, landed on the opposite coast and carried on a war against the Colas, and built a fortress near Rāmnād, which they called Parakkamapura.  They managed to defeat Kulasekhara and restore the crown of Madhurā to the Pāndyan king's son, Vīra Pandu.  The captives taken by the army were sent to Ceylon.

In Malaya was the Ambatthakolalena, from which Dutthagāmanī obtained silver for the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxviii.20).  The hill country provided protection from marauders who invaded Ceylon (E.g., in the case of Vattagāmanī; Mhv.xxxiii.62; also xxxv.26), and also from those causing danger to the rightful ruler (E.g., ibid., xxxvi.50; Cv.xli.20; l.20).  When Buddhism was threatened by the activities of unbelievers who had obtained possession of Anurādhapura, it was to Malaya and to Rohana that the monks fled in order to save themselves and their teaching (E.g., Mhv.xxxvii.6).  Malaya also afforded shelter to rebels against the government both during preparations for attack and, if necessary, during their flight (E.g., Cv.xli.10; xliv.62; xlviii.98; li.112f.; lvii.47, 57).[/p][p]In later times Malaya was treated as a special province, and was in charge of an official called Malayarāja, who was generally the king's younger son, the elder being viceroy in charge of the Eastern Province (Pācīnadesa).

She was the daughter of the chief garland maker of Kosala, and was very good and beautiful.  When she was sixteen she was, one day, on her way to the garden with some companions, carrying with her three portions of sour gruel in a basket.  Meeting the Buddha, she offered them to him and worshipped him.  The Buddha, seeing her wrapt in joy, smiled, and, in answer to Ananda's question, said she would be chief queen of Kosala that very day.  J.iii.405; SA.i.110ff.  It was to explain Mallikā's good fortune that the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kummaasapinda_jat_416,Kummāsapinda Jātaka')"]Kummāsapinda Jātaka[/a] was preached.[/p][p]It happened that Pasenadi, having suffered defeat at the hands of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajatasattu,Ajātasattu')"]Ajātasattu[/a] that very day, was passing by and entered the flower garden, attracted by Mallikā's voice.  Mallikā, seeing him coming, and noting his weariness, seized his horse's bridle.  The king, discovering that she was unmarried, dismounted, and, having rested awhile, his head on her lap, entered the town with her and took her to her own house.  In the evening he sent a chariot for her, and with great honour and pomp brought her from her own home, set her on a heap of jewels and anointed her chief queen.  From that day onward she was the beloved and devoted wife of the king and an undeviating follower of the Buddha (DhA.iii.121f).  The king found her sagacious and practical minded and consulted her and accepted her advice when in difficulty - e.g., in the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asadisadaana,Asadisa')"]Asadisa[/a] [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asadisadaana,-dāna')"]-dāna[/a], wherein he wished to excel his subjects, and again when he was troubled by evil dreams as narrated in the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahasupina_jat_077,Mahāsupīna Jātaka')"]Mahāsupīna Jātaka[/a].  DhA.ii.8ff.  says that Mallikā called the king a simpleton for putting his faith in brahmins and took him to the Buddha, and while the king sat trembling, asked the questions for him and had them explained.  [/p][p]The Jātaka states how Mallikā saved many innocent lives from being sacrificed, and the Buddha declared that in a past life too, as Dinnā (q.v.), she had saved the lives of a large number of people by her wisdom (DhA.ii.15f).[/p][p]Both Mallikā and Pasenadi's other queen,  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaasabhakkhattiyaa,Vāsabhakhattiyā')"]Vāsabhakhattiyā[/a], desired to learn the Dhamma, and, at their request conveyed through Pasenadi, the Buddha asked Ananda to visit the palace regularly and teach them the Doctrine.  Ananda found in Mallikā an apt and ready pupil, conscientious in her work; Vāsabhakhattiyā was not so devoted to her duties.  DhA.i.382f.  For an incident connected with Ananda's visit to the palace, see Vin.iv.158f.[/p][p]Mallika's knowledge of the Dhamma made her wiser than Pasenadi would have desired, and he once, in a moment of great affection, asked if anyone were dearer to her than her own "self." "No, Sire," was the answer; the king was evidently greatly disappointed, for he sought the Buddha, who explained to him that Mallikā, in making that answer, had uttered a great truth (S.i.75; Ud.v.1).  Mallikā, though an exemplary wife, was not without lapses.  Reference is made to the quarrels she had with her husband, once, at least, on the question of conjugal rights, as a result of which they both sulked and had to be reconciled by the Buddha.  J.iv.437; also J.iii.20; in these quarrels the king was probably more to blame than Mallikā; it is said that until reconciled by the Buddha he ignored her very existence, saying that prosperity had turned her head.  [/p][p]The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iii.119ff) relates a ridiculous story about her misbehaviour with a dog in the bath house.  Pasenadi was a witness of this scene, but she was able to convince him that it was the fault of the lighting of the bath house.  Nevertheless, it is said that at the moment of her death she recollected this misdeed, and, as a result, was reborn in  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/aviici,Avīci')"]Avīci[/a].  The king was overcome by grief at Mallika's death, and, after the funeral rites, went to the Buddha to ask where she had been reborn.  The Buddha, not wishing him to know, caused the king to forget the question, every time he came to the vihāra, for a whole week, till Mallikā's suffering in Avīci was over; then he allowed the question to be asked, and he was able to assure Pasenadi that she had been reborn in  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tusita,Tusita')"]Tusita[/a] and to console him in his grief.  It is said (A.iii.57) that Pasenadi was on a visit to the Buddha when a man came with the whispered message that the queen was dead.  It was a terrible shock, "his shoulders drooped, his mouth fell, and he sat brooding, unable to speak."[/p][p]Mallikā had a daughter by Pasenadi; no mention is made of a son.  Probably  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vajiraakumaarii,Vajīrī')"]Vajīrī[/a], who is spoken of as the king's only daughter (M.ii.110).  He is said to have been disappointed on hearing that the child was a girl; but the Buddha assured him that women were sometimes wiser than men (S.i.86f).[/p][p]Mallikā is mentioned (Mil.  115, 291) as one of seven persons whose acts of devotion bore fruit in this life and whose fame reached even to the gods.  Only one instance is on record of Mallikā asking a question of the Buddha.  She wished to know why some women are plain, others beautiful, some rich, and others poor.  And the Buddha explained to her the reasons for these discrepancies (See  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mallikaa_s,Mallikā Sutta 1')"]Mallikā Sutta 1[/a]).[/p][p]In the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/piyajatika_sutta,Piyajātika Sutta')"]Piyajātika Sutta[/a] (M.ii.106ff ) Pasenadi is said to have taunted her because "her recluse Gotama" had said that dear ones bring sorrow and tribulation.  "If the Lord says so, it must be so," she replies; but secretly sends Nālijangha to find out from the Buddha himself if he had said so and why.  Having learnt the facts, she faces Pasenadi again, and convinced him too that the Buddha is right.[/p][p]Mallikā had a garden, called the Mallikārāma, in which was a Hall among the Deispyros trees (tindukācīra) set apart for religious discussions between members of various sects (samayappavādaka).

  <e>[div class="huge"]Magadha[/div][p]One of the four chief kingdoms of India at the time of the Buddha, the others being Kosala, the kingdom of the Vamsas and Avanti.  Magadha formed one of the sixteen Mahājanapadas and had its capital at Rājagaha or Giribbaja where Bimbisāra, and after him Ajātasattu, reigned.  Later, Pātaliputta became the capital.  By the time of Bimbisāra, Anga, too, formed a part of Magadha, and he was known as king of Anga Magadha (see, e.g., Vin.i.27 and ThagA.i.544, where Bimbisāra sends for Sona Kolivisa, a prominent citizen of Campā, capital of Anga).  But prior to that, these were two separate kingdoms, often at war with each other (e.g., J.iv.454f).  Several kings of Magadha are mentioned by name in the Jātakas - e.g., Arindama and Duyyodhana.  In one story (J.vi.272) the Magadha kingdom is said to have been under the suzerainty of Anga.  In the Buddha's day, Magadha (inclusive of Anga) consisted of eighty thousand villages (Vin.i.179) and had a circumference of some three hundred leagues (DA.i.148).[/p][p]Ajātasattu succeeded in annexing Kosala with the help of the Licchavis, and he succeeded also in bringing the confederation of the latter under his sway; preliminaries to this struggle are mentioned in the books (e.g., D.ii.73f., 86).[/p][p]Under Bimbisāra and Ajātasattu, Magadha rose to such political eminence that for several centuries, right down to the time of Asoka, the history of Northern India was practically the history of Magadha.  (A list of the kings from Bimbisāra to Asoka is found in Dvy.369 ; cp.  DA.i.153; Mbv.96, 98).[/p][p][/p][p]At the time of the Buddha, the kingdom of Magadha was bounded on the east by the river Campā (Campā flowed between Anga and Magadha; J.iv.454), on the south by the Vindhyā Mountains, on the west by the river Sona, and on the north by the Ganges.  The latter river formed the boundary between Magadha and the republican country of the Licchavis, and both the Māgadhas and the Licchavis evidently had equal rights over the river.  When the Buddha visited Vesāli, Bimbisāra made a road five leagues long, from Rājagaha to the river, and decorated it, and the Licchavis did the same on the other side.  DhA.iii.439 f.; the Dvy.  (1p.55) says that monks going from Sāvatthi to Rājagaha could cross the Ganges in boats kept either by Ajātasattu or by the Licchavis of Vesāli.[/p][p]During the early Buddhist period Magadha was an important political and commercial centre, and was visited by people from all parts of Northern India in search of commerce and of learning.  The kings of Magadha maintained friendly relations with their neighbours, Bimbisāra and Pasenadi marrying each other's sisters.  Mention is made of an alliance between Pukkusāti, king of Gandhāra and Bimbisāra.  When Candappajjota of Ujjeni was suffering from jaundice, Bimbisāra sent him his own personal physician, Jīvaka.[/p][p][/p][p]In Magadha was the real birth of Buddhism (see, e.g., the words put in the mouth of Sahampatī in Vin.i.5, pātur ahosi Magadhesu pubbe dhammo, etc.), and it was from Magadha that it spread after the Third Council.  The Buddha's chief disciples, Sāriputta and Moggallāna, came from Magadha.  In Asoka's time the income from the four gates of his capital of Pātaliputta was four hundred thousand kahāpanas daily, and in the Sabhā, or Council, he would daily receive another hundred thousand kahāpanas (Sp.i.52).  The cornfields of Magadha were rich and fertile (Thag.vs.208), and each Magadha field was about one gāvuta in extent.  Thus AA.ii.616 explains the extent of Kakudha's body, which filled two or three Māgadha village fields (A.iii.122).[/p][p]The names of several places in Magadha occur in the books- e.g., Ekanālā, NāIakagāma, Senānigāma, Khānumata, Andhakavindha, Macala, Mātulā, Ambalatthikā, Pātaligāma, NāIandā and SāIindiya.[/p][p]Buddhaghosa says (SNA.i.135 f ) that there are many fanciful explanations (bahudhā papañcanti) of the word Magadha.  One such is that king Cetiya, when about to be swallowed up by the earth for having introduced lying into the world, was thus admonished by those standing round - "Mā gadham pavisa;” another that those who were digging in the earth saw the king, and that he said to them: " Mā gadham karotha." The real explanation, accepted by Buddhaghosa himself, seems to have been that the country was the residence of a tribe of khattiyas called Magadhā.[/p][p][/p][p]The Magadhabhāsā is regarded as the speech of the Āriyans (e.g., Sp.i.255).  If children grow up without being taught any language, they will spontaneously use the Magadha language; it is spread all over Niraya, among lower animals, petas, humans and devas (VibhA.387f).[/p][p][/p][p]The people of Anga and Magadha were in the habit of holding a great annual sacrifice to Māha Brahmā in which a fire was kindled with sixty cartloads of firewood.  They held the view that anything cast into the sacrificial fire would bring a thousand fold reward.  SA.i.269; but it is curious that in Vedic, Brāhmana and Sūtra periods, Magadha was considered as outside the pale of Ariyan and Brahmanical culture, and was therefore looked down upon by Brahmanical writers.  But it was the holy land of the Buddhists.  See VT.ii.207; Thomas: op.  cit., 13, 96.[/p][p]Magadha was famous for a special kind of garlic (Sp.iv.920) and the Magadha nāla was a standard of measure.  (E.g., AA.i.101).[/p][p]Magadha is identified with the modern South Behar.  See also  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/magadhakhetta,Magadhakhetta')"]Magadhakhetta[/a].[/p]</e>

A cowherd, who stood leaning on a stick, drove it unwittingly into the frog's head and it died immediately, to be reborn in Tāvatimsa in a palace twelve yojanas in extent.  Having discovered his previous birth, he appeared before the Buddha, revealed his identity and worshipped him.  The Buddha preached to him, and the deva became a sotāpanna.

Their bodies thus become feeble and their minds imbecile, and, as a consequence, they fall from their state (D.i.20; iii.32).[/p][p]The Manopadosikā were among those present at the preaching of the Mahāsamaya Sutta (D.ii.260).

He was religious by nature, and, when he came of age, became a Paribbājaka.  Later, he heard the Buddha preach and joined the Order, becoming an Arahant (ThagA.i.446f).  The Theragāthā contains two sets of verses attributed to him: one (vv.  399 404) spoken on his visit to his home after attaining arahantship when his people tried to lure him back by a great display of hospitality; the other* in connection with a brief sermon preached to him by the Buddha before he became an Arahant.  The Thera asked the Buddha for a doctrine in brief and the Buddha gave him one.  The verses contain a detailed account of the stanzas which were only outlined to him by the Buddha.[/p][p]In the Majjhima Nikāya are two suttas - the Cūla Mālunkyā and the Mahā, Mālunkyā (this is referred to at Mil.  144) - both evidently preached before Mālunkyāputta's attainment of arahantship, because in both the Buddha speaks disparagingly of him.[/p][p]* vv.  794-817; the reference is probably to the Mālunkyāputta Sutta of A.ii.248; see also S.iv.72, where the verses are quoted in full.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Māra[/div][p]Generally regarded as the personification of Death, the Evil One, the Tempter (the Buddhist counterpart of the Devil or Principle of Destruction).  The legends concerning Māra are, in the books, very involved and defy any attempts at unravelling them.  In the latest accounts, mention is made of five Māras [/p][ol][li]Khandha Māra, [/li][li]Kilesa Māra, [/li][li]Abhisankhāra Māra, [/li][li]Maccu Māra and [/li][li]Devaputta Māra [/li][/ol][p]as shown in the following quotations: pañcannam pi Mārānam vijayato jino (ThagA.ii.16); sabbāmittehi khandha-kilesā-bhisankhāramaccudeva-puttasankhāte, sabbapaccatthike (ThagA.ii.46); sankhepato vā pañcakilesa-khandhābhi-sankhāra-devaputta-maccumāre abhañji, tasmā .  .  .  bhagavā ti vuccati (Vsm.211).  [/p][p]Elsewhere, however, Māra is spoken of as one, three, or four.  Where Māra is one, the reference is generally either to the kilesas or to Death.  Thus: Mārenāti kilesamārena (ItvA.197); Mārassa visaye ti kilesamārassa visaye (ThagA.ii.70); jetvāna maccuno senam vimokkhena anāvaran ti lokattayābhibyāpanato diyaddhasahassādi vibhāgato ca vipulattā aññehi avāritum patisedhetum asakkuneyyattā ca maccuno, Mārassa, senam vimokkhena ariyamaggena jetvā (ItvA.198); Mārāsenā ti ettha satte anatthe niyojento māretīti Māro (UdA.325); nihato Māro bodhimūle ti vihato samucchinno kilesamāro bodhirukkhamūle (Netti Cty.  235); vasam Mārassa gacchatīti kilesamārassa ca sattamārassa (?) ca vasam gacchi (Netti, p.  86); tato sukhmnataram Mārabandhanan ti kilesabandhanam pan' etam tato sukhumataram (SA.iii.82); Māro māro ti maranam pucchati, māradhammo ti maranadhammo (SA.ii.246).[/p][p]It is evidently with this same significance that the term Māra, in the older books, is applied to the whole of the worldly existence, the five khandhas, or the realm of rebirth, as opposed to Nibbāna.  Thus Māra is defined at CNid.  (No.  506) as kammābhisankhāravasena patisandhiko kandhamāro dhātumāro, āyatanamāro.  And again: Māro Māro ti bhante vuccati katamo nu kho bhante Māro ti? Rūpam kho, Rādha, Māro, vedanāmāro, saññāmāro, sankhāramāro viññānam Māro (S.iii.195); yo kho Rādha Māro tatra chando pahātabbo.  Ko ca Rādha Māro?

Tasmā he tvam Rādha rūpam māro ti passa māretā ti passa mīyatīti passa ...  ye nam evam passanti te sammā passanti (S.iii.189); Mārasamyogan ti tebhūmakavattam (SNA.ii.506).[/p][p]The Commentaries also speak of three Māras: bodhipallanke tinnam Mārānam matthakam bhinditvā (DA.ii.659); aparājitasanghan ti ajj' eva tayo Māre madditvā vijitasangānam matthakam madditvā anuttaram sammāsambodhim abhisambuddho (CNidA.  p.  47).  In some cases the three Māras are specified: yathayidam bhikkhave mārabalan ti yathā idam devaputtamāra maccumāra kilesamārānam balam appasaham durabhisambhavam (DA.iii.858); maccuhāyino ti maranamaccu kilesamccu devaputtamaccu hāyino, tividham pi tam maccum hitvā gāmino ti vuttam hoti (SNA.ii.508; cp.  MA.ii.619); na lacchati Māro otāram, Māro ti devaputtmāro pi maccumāro pi kilesamāro pi (DA.iii.846); but elsewhere five are mentioned e.g., ariyamaggakkhane kilesamāro abhisahkhāramāro, devaputtamāro ca carimaka cittakkhane khandhamāro maccumāro ti pañcavidhamāro abhibhūto parājito (UdA.216).  Very occasionally four Māras are mentioned: catunnam Mārānam matthakam madditvā anuttaram sammāsambodhim abhisamabuddho (MNid.  129); indakhīlopamo catubbidhamāraparavādiganehi akampiyatthena (SNA.i.201); Mārasenam sasenam abhibhuyyāti kilesasenāya anantasenāya ca sasenam anavasittham, catubbidham pi māram abhibhavitvā devaputtamārassā pi hi gunamārane sahāyabhāvūpagamanato kilesā senā ti vuccanti (ItvA.136).  The last quotation seems to indicate that the four Māras are the five Māras less Devaputta Māra.[/p][p]A few particulars are available about Devaputta Māra: Māro ti Vasavattibhūmiyam aññataro dāmarikadevaputto.  So hi tam thānam atikkamitukāmam janam yam na sakkoti tam māreti, yam na sakkoti tassa pi maranam icchati, tenā Māro ti vuccati (SNA.i.44); Māro yeva pana sattasankhātāya pajāya adhipatibhāvena idha Pajāpatīti adhippeto.  So hi kuhim vasatīti? Paranimmittavasavattidevaloke.  Tatra hi Vasavattirājā rajjam kāreti.  Māro ekasmim padese attano parisāya issariyam pavattento rajjapaccante dāmarikarājapittto viya vasatī ti vadanti (MA.i.28); so hi Māro opapātiko kāmāvacarissaro, kadāci brahmapārisajjānampi kāye adhimuccitum samattho (Jinālankāra Tīkā, p.217).[/p][p]In view of the many studies of Māra by various scholars, already existing, it might be worth while here, too, to attempt a theory of Māra in Buddhism, based chiefly on the above data.  The commonest use of the word was evidently in the sense of Death.  From this it was extended to mean "the world under the sway of death" (also called Māradheyya - e.g., A.iv.228) and the beings therein.  Thence, the kilesas also came to be called Māra in that they were instruments of Death, the causes enabling Death to hold sway over the world.  All Temptations brought about by the kilesas were likewise regarded as the work of Death.  There was also evidently a legend of a devaputta of the Vasavatti world, called Māra, who considered himself the head of the Kāmāvacara world and who recognized any attempt to curb the enjoyment of sensual pleasures, as a direct challenge to himself and to his authority.  As time went on these different conceptions of the word became confused one with the other, but this confusion is not always difficult to unravel.[/p][p]Various statements are found in the Pitakas connected with Māra, which have, obviously, reference to Death, the kilesas, and the world over which Death and the kilesas hold sway.  Thus: Those who can restrain the mind and check its propensities can escape the snares of Māra (Dhp.  Yamaka, vs.  7).  He who delights in objects cognizant to the eye, etc., has gone under Māra's sway (S.iv.91).  He who has attachment is entangled by Māra (S.iii.73).  Māra will overthrow him who is unrestrained in his senses, immoderate in his food, idle and weak (Dhp.  Yamaka, vs.  8).  By attaining the Noble Eightfold Path one can be free from Māra (Dhp.  vs.  40).  The Samyutta (i.  135) records a conversation between Māra and Vajirā.  She has attained arahantship, and tells Māra: "There is no satta here who can come under your control; there is no being but a mere heap of sankhāras (suddhasankhārarapuñja).[/p][p]The later books, especially the Nidānakathā of the Jātaka Commentary (J.i.71ff.; cp.  MA.i.384) and the Buddhavamsa Commentary (p.  239f), contain a very lively and detailed description of the temptation of the Buddha by Māra, as the Buddha sat under the Bodhi tree immediately before his Enlightenment.  These accounts describe how Māra, the devaputta, seeing the Bodhisatta seated, with the firm resolve, of becoming a Buddha, summoned all his forces and advanced against him.  These forces extended to a distance of twelve yojanas to the front of the Bodhisatta, twelve to the back, and nine each to the right and to the left.  Māra himself, thousand armed, rode on his elephant, Girimekhala, one hundred and fifty leagues in height.  His followers assumed various fearsome shapes and were armed with dreadful weapons.  At Māra's approach, all the various Devas, Nāgas and others, who were gathered round the Bodhisatta singing his praises and paying him homage, disappeared in headlong flight.  The Bodhisatta was left alone, and he called to his assistance the ten pārami which he had practiced to perfection.[/p][p]Māra's army is described as being tenfold, and each division of the army is described, in very late accounts (especially in Singhalese books), with great wealth of detail.  Each division was faced by the Buddha with one pāramī and was put to flight.  Māra's last weapon was the Cakkāvudha (q.v.).  But when he hurled it at the Buddha it stood over him like a canopy of flowers.  Still undaunted, Māra challenged the Buddha to show that the seat on which he sat was his by right.  Māra's followers all shouted their evidence that the seat was Māra's.  The Buddha, having no other witness, asked the Earth to bear testimony on his behalf, and the Earth roared in response.  Māra and his followers fled in utter rout, and the Devas and others gathered round the Buddha to celebrate his victory.  The sun set on the defeat of Māra.  This, in brief, is the account of the Buddha's conquest of Māra, greatly elaborated in later chronicler, and illustrated in countless Buddhist shrines and temples with all the wealth of riotous color and fanciful imagery that gifted artists could command.[/p][p]That this account of the Buddha's struggle with Māra is literally true, none but the most ignorant of the Buddhists believe, even at the present day.  The Buddhist point of view has been well expressed by Rhys Davids (Article on Buddha in the Ency.  Brit.).  We are to understand by the attack of Māra's forces, that all the Buddha's "old temptations came back upon him with renewed force.  For years he had looked at all earthly good through the medium of a philosophy which had taught him that it, without exception, carried within itself the seeds of bitterness and was altogether worthless and impermanent; but now, to his wavering faith, the sweet delights of home and love, the charms of wealth and power, began to show themselves in a different light and glow again with attractive colors.  He doubted and agonized in his doubt, but as the sun set, the religious side of his nature had won the victory and seems to have come out even purified from the struggle." There is no need to ask, as does Thomas, with apparently great suspicion (Thomas, op.  cit., 230), whether we can assume that the elaborators of the Māra story were recording "a subjective experience under the form of an objective reality," and did they know or think that this was the real psychological experience which the Buddha went through? The living traditions of the Buddhist countries supply the adequate answer, without the aid of the rationalists.  The epic nature of the subject gave ample scope for the elaboration so dear to the hearts of the Pāli rhapsodists.[/p][p]The similar story among Jains, as recorded in their commentarial works - e.g., in the Uttarādhyayana Sūtra (ZDMG.  vol.  49 (1915), 321ff ) bears no close parallelism to the Buddhist account, but only a faint resemblance.[/p][p]There is no doubt that the Māra legend had its origin in the Padhāna Sutta (q.v.).  There Māra is represented as visiting Gotama on the banks of the Nerañjarā, where he is practicing austerities and tempting him to abandon his striving and devote himself to good works.  Gotama refers to Māra's army as being tenfold.  The divisions are as follows: the first consists of the Lusts; the second is Aversion; the third Hunger and Thirst; the fourth Craving; the fifth Sloth and Indolence; the sixth Cowardice; the seventh Doubt; the eighth Hypocrisy and Stupidity; Gains, Fame, Honour and Glory falsely obtained form the ninth; and the tenth is the Lauding of oneself and the Contemning of others.  "Seeing this army on all sides," says the Buddha, "I go forth to meet Māra with his equipage (savāhanam).  He shall not make me yield ground.  That army of thine, which the world of devas and men conquers not, even that, with my wisdom, will I smite, as an unbaked earthen bowl with a stone." Here we have practically all the elements found in the later elaborated versions.[/p][p]The second part of the Padhāna Sutta (SN.  vs.  446f.; cf.  S.i.122) is obviously concerned with later events in the life of Gotama, and this the Commentary (SNA.ii.391) definitely tells us.  After Māra had retired discomfited, he followed the Buddha for seven years, watching for any transgression on his part.  But the quest was in vain, and, "like a crow attacking a rock," he left Gotama in disgust.  "The lute of Māra, who was so overcome with grief, slipped from his arm.  Then, in dejection, the Yakkha disappeared thence." This lute, according to the Commentary (SNA.ii.394), was picked up by Sakka and given to Pañcasikha.  Of this part of the sutta, more anon.[/p][p]The Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.124f.; given also at Lal.  490 (378); cp.  A.v.46; see also DhA.iii.195f ) also contains a sutta ("Dhītaro" Sutta) in which three daughters of Māra are represented as tempting the Buddha after his Enlightenment.  Their names are Tanhā, Arati and Ragā, and they are evidently personifications of three of the ten forces in Māra's army, as given in the Padhāna Sutta.  They assume numerous forms of varying age and charm, full of blandishment, but their attempt is vain, and they are obliged to admit defeat.[/p][p]Once Māra came to be regarded as the Spirit of Evil all temptations of lust, fear, greed, etc., were regarded as his activities, and Māra was represented as assuming various disguises in order to carry out his nefarious plans.  Thus the books mention various occasions on which Māra appeared before the Buddha himself and his disciples, men and women, to lure them away from their chosen path.[/p][p]Soon after the Buddha's first vassa, Māra approached him and asked him not to teach the monks regarding the highest emancipation, he himself being yet bound by Māra's fetters.  But the Buddha replied that he was free of all fetters, human and divine (Vin.i.22).  On another occasion Māra entered into the body of Vetambarī and made him utter heretical doctrines.  (S.i.67; cp.  DhA.iv.141, where Māra asks the Buddha about the further shore.  In the Brahmanimantanika Sutta (M.i.326) Māra is spoken of as entering the hearts even of the inhabitants, of the Brahma world).  The Māra Samyutta (S.i.103ff ) contains several instances of Māra's temptations of the Buddha by assailing him with doubts as to his emancipation, feelings of fear and dread, appearing before him in the shape of an elephant, a cobra, in various guises beautiful and ugly, making the rocks of Gijjhakūta fall with a crash; by making him wonder whether he should ever sleep; by suggesting that, as human life was long, there was no need for haste in living the good life; by dulling the intelligence of his hearers (E.g., at Ekasalā; cf.  Nigrodha and his fellow Paribbājakas, D.iii.58).  Once, when the Buddha was preaching to the monks, Māra came in the guise of a bullock and broke their bowls, which were standing in the air to dry; on another occasion he made a great din so that the minds of the listening monks were distracted.  Again, when the Buddha went for alms to Pañcasālā, he entered into the brahmin householders and the Buddha had to return with empty bowl.  Māra approached the Buddha on his return and tried to persuade him to try once more; this was, says the Commentary, a ruse, that he might inspire insult and injury in addition to neglect.  But the Buddha refused, saying that he would live that day on pīti, like the Abhassara gods.  The incident is related at length in SA.i.140f.  and DhA.iii.257f.; the Commentaries (e.g., Sp.i.178f.) state that the difficulty experienced by the Buddha and his monks in obtaining food at Verañja (q.v.) was also due to the machinations of Māra.[/p][p]Again, as the Buddha was preaching to the monks on Nibbāna, Māra came in the form of a peasant and interrupted the sermon to ask if anyone had seen his oxen.  His desire was to make the cares of the present life break in on the calm and supramundane atmosphere of the discourse on Nibbāna.  On another occasion he tempted the Buddha with the fascination of exercising power that he might rescue those suffering from the cruelty of rulers.  Once, at the Sākyan village of Sīlavatī, he approached the monks who were bent on study, in the shape of a very old and holy brahmin, and asked them not to abandon the things of this life, in order to run after matters involving time.  In the same village, he tried to frighten Samiddhi away from his meditations.  Samiddhi sought the Buddha's help and went back and won arahantship.  (Cp.  the story of Nandiya Thera.  Buddhaghosa says (DA.iii.864) that when Sūrambattha, after listening to a sermon of the Buddha, had returned home, Māra visited him there in the guise of the Buddha and told him that what he (the Buddha) had preached to him earlier was false.  Sūrambattha, though surprised, could not be shaken in his faith, being a sotāpanna).  Māra influenced Godhika to commit suicide and tried to frighten Rāhula in the guise of a huge elephant.  (DhA.iv.69f ).  In the account of Godhika's suicide (S.i.122) there is a curious statement that, after Godhika died, Māra went about looking for his (Godhika's) consciousness (patisandhicitta), and the Buddha pointed him out to the monks, "going about like a cloud of smoke." Later, Māra came to the Buddha, like a little child (khuddadārakavannī), (SA.i.145) holding a vilva lyre of golden color, and he questioned the Buddha about Godhika.  (This probably refers to some dispute which arose among the monks regarding Godhika's destiny.)[/p][p]The books mention many occasions on which Māra assumed various forms under which to tempt bhikkhunīs, often in lonely spots - e.g., Ālavikā, Kisāgotamī, Somā, Vijayā, Uppalavantnā, Cālā, Upacālā, Sisūpacālā, Selā, Vajirā and Khemā.  To the same category of temptations belongs a story found in late commentaries (J.i.63): when Gotama was leaving his palace on his journey of Renunciation, Māra, here called Vasavattī, appeared before him and promised him the kingdom and the whole world within seven days if he would but turn back.  Māra's temptations were not confined to monks and nuns; he tempted also lay men and women and tried to lure them from the path of goodness - e.g., in the story of Dhaniya and his wife.  (SNA.i.44; see also J.i.231f).[/p][p]Mention is made, especially in the Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta, of several occasions on which Māra approached the Buddha, requesting him to die; the first of these occasions was under the Ajapala Banyan tree at Uruvelā, soon after the Enlightenment, but the Buddha refused to die until the sāsana was firmly established.  Can it be that here we have the word Māra used in the sense of physical death (Maccumāra), and that the occasions referred to were those on which the Buddha felt the desire to die, to pass away utterly, to "lay down the burden"? Perhaps they were moments of physical fatigue, when he lay at death's door, for we know (see Gotama) that the six years he spent in austerities made inroads on his health and that he suffered constantly from muscular cramp, digestive disorders and headache.  (It is true that in the Mahāsaccaka Sutta (M.i.240ff.), which contains an account of the events leading up to the Enlightenment, there is no mention whatsoever of any temptation by Mara, nor is there any mention of the Bodhi tree.  But to argue from this, that such events did not form part of the original story, might be to draw unwarranted inferences from an argumentum e silentio.) At Beluvagāma, shortly before he finally decided to die, we are told (D.ii.99; cp.  Dvy.  203) that "there fell upon him a dire sickness, and sharp pains came upon him even unto death." But the Buddha conquered the disease by a strong effort of his will because he felt it would not be right for him to die without addressing his followers and taking leave of the Order.  Compare with this Māra's temptation of the Buddha at Maddakucchi (q.v.), when he laid suffering from severe pain after the wounding of his foot by a splinter.  It may have been the physical weariness, above referred to, which at first made the Buddha reluctant to take upon himself the great exertions which the propagation of his Dhamma would involve (e.g., Vin.i.4f).  We know of other arahants who actually committed suicide in order to escape being worried by physical ills - e.g., Godhika, Vakkali, Channa.  When their suicide was reported to the Buddha, he declared them free from all blame.[/p][p]Can it be, further, that with the accounts of Māra, as the personification of Evil, came to be mixed legends of an actual devaputta, named Māra, also called Vasavatti, because he was an inhabitant of the Paranimmita Vasavatti deva world? Already in the Anguttara Nikāya, Māra is described (aggo ādhipateyyānam iddhiyā yasasā jalam) as the head of those enjoying bliss in the Kāmāvacara worlds and as a dāmarika devaputta (as mentioned earlier).  A.ii.17. Even after the Buddha's death Māra was regarded as wishing to obstruct good works.  Thus, at the enshrinement of the Buddha's relics in the Mahā Thūpa, Indagutta Thera (by supernatural power) made a parasol of copper to cover the universe, in order that it might ward off the attentions of Māra (Mhv.xxxi.85).[/p][p]Can it be that ancient legends represented him as looking on with disfavour at the activities of the Buddha? Buddhaghosa says (MA.i.533) that Māradevaputta, having dogged the Buddha's footsteps for seven years, and having found no fault in him, came to him and worshipped him.  Is it, then, possible that some of the conversations, which the Buddha is reported to have had with Māra - e.g., in the second part of the Padhāna Sutta (see above) were originally ascribed to a real personage, designated as Māradevaputta, and later confused with the allegorical Māra? This suggestion gains strength from a remark found in the Māratajjaniya Sutta (M.i.333; cp.  D.iii.79) uttered by Moggallāna, that he too had once been a Māra, Dūsī by name; Kālā was his sister's name, and the Māra of the present age was his nephew.  In the sutta, Dūsī is spoken of as having been responsible for many acts of mischief, similar to those ascribed to the Māra of Gotama's day.  According to the sutta, Māradevaputta was evidently regarded as a being of great power, with a strong bent for mischief, especially directed against holy men.  This suggestion is, at all events, worthy of further investigation.  See also Mārakāyikā deva.[/p][p]Māra bears many names in Pāli Literature, chief of them being Kanha, Adhipati, Antaka, Namuci and Pamattabandhu.  (MNid.ii.489; for their explanation see MNidA.328; another name of Māra was Pajāpati, MA.i.28).  His usual standing epithet is pāpimā, but other words are also used, such as anatthakāma, ahitakāma, and ayogakkhemakāma (E.g., M.i.118).[/p][p]Māra is called Namuci because none can escape him Namucī ti Māro; so hi attano visayā nikkhamitukāme devamanusse na muñcati antarāyam tesam karoti tasma Namucī ti vuccati (SNA.ii.386).  In the Mahāsamaya Sutta, Namuci is mentioned among the Asuras as being present in the assembly.  D.ii.259; elsewhere in the same sutta (p.  261f.) it is said that when all the devas and others had assembled to hear the Buddha preach, Mara came with his "swarthy host" and attempted to blind the assembly with thoughts of lust, etc.  But the Buddha, seeing him, warned his followers against him and Māra had to depart unsuccessful.  At the end of the sutta, four lines are traditionally ascribed to Māra.  They express admiration of the Buddha and his followers.  In this sutta Māra is described as mahāsena (having a large army).[/p][p]The Commentary explains (DA.ii.689) that Namuci refers to Māradevaputta and accounts for his presence among the Asuras by the fact that he was temperamentally their companion (te pi acchandikā abhabbā, ayam pi tādiso yeva, tasmā dhātuso samsandamāno āgato).  Buddhaghosa says (SA.i.133; cp.  MNidA.  328) that Māra is so called because he destroys all those who seek to evade him attano visayam atikkamitum patipanne satte māreti ti Māro; he is called Vasavatti (SA.i.158) because he rules all Māro nāma vasavattī sabesam upari vasam vattati.[/p][p]Kālī (Kālā) is the mother of Māra of the present age.

He won the king's favor and very loyally helped him to defeat the Vallabha king.  He then raised an army with the help of Narasīha, landed in Ceylon, and recovered the kingdom from Dāthopatissa.  But later his army deserted him on hearing tidings of Narasīha's illness and Māna returned once more to Jambudīpa.

Several days in succession this happened, until at last, by dint of listening to them, Mahilāmukha became cruel and began to kill his keepers.

On the fourth day he preached the Anamatagga Sutta in Nandanavana and helped the king in defining the boundaries of what later became the Mahāvihāra.  On the fifth day he preached the Khajjanīya Sutta, on the sixth the Gomayapindī sutta, and on the seventh the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta.[/p][p]The pāsāda first built for the residence of Mahinda was called Kālapāsāda parivena.  Other buildings associated with him were the Sunhātaparivena, the Dīghacanka parivena, the Phalagga parivena, the Therāpassaya parivena, the Marugana-parivena, and the Dīghasandasenāpati-parivena.  [/p][p]Twenty six days Mahinda stayed in Mahāmeghavana, and on the thirteenth day of the bright half of Āsālha, after having preached the Mahāppamāda Sutta, he went to Missakapabbata, to spend the vassa.  The king had sixty eight rock cells built in the mountain and gave them to the theras on the full moon day.  On the same day Mahinda ordained sixty two monks, who attained arahantship, at Tumbarumālaka.  After the full moon day of Kattika, at the conclusion of the pavārana ceremony, Mahinda held a consultation with Devānampiyatissa and sent Sumanasāmanera to Pātaliputta to bring the relics of the Buddha from Dhammāsoka and other relics from Sakka.  These relics were brought and placed on the Missakapabbata, which from then onwards was called Cetiyegiri.  The collar bone from among the relics was deposited in the Thūpārāma (q.v.), which was built for the purpose.  It was at Mahinda's suggestion that Devānampiyatissa sent an embassy headed by Mahāarittha to Asoka, with a request that Sanghamittā should come to Ceylon with a branch of the Bodhi tree.  The request was granted, and Sanghamittā arrived in Ceylon with the branch.  Devānampiyatissa, during the later part of his reign, acting on the advice of Mahinda, built numerous vihāras, each one yojana from the other; among them were Issarasamanaka and Vessagiri.[/p][p]Mahinda is said to have taught the Commentaries to the Tipitaka in, the Singhalese language, after translating them from the Pāli (Cv.xxxvii.228ff).[/p][p]The Samantapāsādikā (pp.  102ff ) mentions a recital held by Mahinda under the presidency of Mahāarittha.[/p][p]Mahinda continued to live for the first eight years of the reign of Uttiya, who succeeded Devānampiyatissa.  Then, at the age of sixty, he died on the eighth day of the bright half of Assayuja, in Cetiyagiri, where he was spending the rainy season.  His body was brought in procession, with every splendor and honour, to the Mahāvihāra and placed in the Pañhambamālaka, where homage was paid to it for a whole week.  It was then burnt on a pyre of fragrant wood on the east of the Therānambandhamālaka, to the left of the site of the Mahā Thūpa.  A cetiya was erected on that spot over half the remains, the other half being distributed in thūpas built on Cetiyagiri and elsewhere.  The place of cremation was called Isibhūmangana, and there for many centuries were cremated the remains of holy men who lived within a distance of three yojanas.( For details of Mahinda see Mhv.xiii.  xx; Dpv.vii.57f., xii., xiii., iv.: xv.; Sp.i.61, 69ff., 79ff., 83ff., 90ff., 103, etc.)[/p][p]Later, King Sirimeghavanip had a life size image of Mahinda made of gold; this he took to the Ambatthalacetiya.  For eight days a festival was held in its honour; on the ninth day the image was taken from Ambatthala, carried by the king himself at the head of a large and splendid procession, and placed for three days in Sotthiyākara vihāra.  On the twelfth day it was taken with all splendours to Anurādhapura, to the Mahāvihāra, where it was left for three months in the courtyard of the Bodhi tree.  From there it was removed to the inner city and deposited in a magnificent image house to the south east of the palace.  An endowment was set up for the annual performance of ceremonies in honour of the image, and this custom was continued for many centuries.  The image was brought from the inner town to the (Mahā)vihāra on the pavārana day, and every year an offering was made on the thirteenth day (Cv.xxxvii.66ff).[/p][p]Dhātusena had the image brought to the place where Mahinda's body was cremated and there held a great festival (Cv.xxxviii.58), while Aggabodhi I.  set up the image on the banks of the tank called Mahindatata, and ensured that the special task of carrying the image to the dyke of the tank was the task of the Taracchas.

He refused to be crowned, out of sorrow for the death of his friend Nīla, and administered the government as ādipāda.  He thus came to be known as Adipāda Mahinda.  His brother's son, Aggabodhi, was his viceroy, while his own son was made ruler of Dakkhinadesa.[/p][p]He gave ten cartloads of food to the Mahāpāli and would eat nothing without first giving of it to beggars.  He built a nunnery for the bhikkhunīs (called Mahindaupassaya) and gave to it the village of Nagaragalla.  He also built the Mahindatata vihāra.  Cv.xiviii.26ff.[/p][hr][p][b]6.

Aggabodhi made him senāpati and gave over the government to him.  But when Aggabodhi VI.  died and Aggabodhi VII.  came to the throne, Mahinda went to Mahātittha.  Later, on the death of Aggabodhi VII., Mahinda quelled all disturbances and put the queen in chains because she conspired to kill him.  His cousin Dappula rose against him, but was defeated after much fighting.  Mahinda then married the queen of Aggabodhi VI.  and became king as Mahinda II., when a son was born to him.  Dappula again rose in revolt, but Mahinda made a treaty with him and gave him part of Rohana with the Gālhagangā as boundary.[/p][p]Among Mahinda's benefactions was the erection of the Dāmavihāra-parivena and the Sannīratittha vihāra in Pulatthipura, also the costly Ratanapāsāda, containing a golden image of the Buddha.  To the Silāmegha nunnery Mahinda gave a silver Bodhisatta statue.  He had the Abhidhamma recited by the monks of Hemasāli Vihāra, and built many shrines and helped those who were poor or in trouble.  To the lame he gave bulls and to the Damilas horses.  He strengthened the weir of the Kālavāpi.  He reigned for twenty years (772 92 A.C.) and was succeeded by his son Udaya I.  (Cv.xlviii.83ff).[/p][hr][p][b]8. Mahinda.[/b] Son of the Adipāda Dāthāsīva of Rohana.  He quarreled with his father, took service under Udaya I.  and married his daughter Devā.

He married Tissā and Kitti.  He became viceroy under Sena II.  and ruled in Dakkhinadesa.  Later he was discovered guilty of an intrigue in the king's harem, and fled, unrecognized, with his family, to Malaya.  Afterwards, however, he regained his honors and continued as viceroy, his daughter Sanghā being married to Kassapa, son of Sena II.  Mahinda built a temple under the Bodhi tree, and, in the course of its construction, a workman discovered that one of the beams would harm a branch of the tree.  Mahinda, on being informed of this, came and made a saccakiriyā, as a result of which the branch of the tree straightened itself during the night, leaving the building free.  Mahinda also built the Mahindasena parivena, and died in the twenty third year of Sena's reign (Cv.l.59; li.7, 13, 15ff., 53ff).  Adipāda Kittaggabodhi was his Son.  Ibid., 94.[/p][hr][p][b]14.

When the Adipāda Kittaggabodhi raised a rebellion in Rohana against Udaya II., the latter sent Mahinda to quell it with the help of the general Vajiragga.  The expedition was completely successful and Kittaggabodhi taken prisoner.  Mahinda stayed in Mahāgāma and ruled over Rohana justly and well.  Among his works was the construction of a dam across the Mahānadī (Cv.li.99ff).  When Kassapa IV.  became king, Mahinda revolted against him, but the king, through the influence of Mahinda's father, persuaded him to desist.  Later, Mahinda returned to Anurādhapura at the request of the monks, and, after having married the king's daughter, went back to Rohana, where, evidently, he died.  Cv.lii.4ff.[/p][hr][p][b]15. Mahinda.[/b] Viceroy of Sena IV.  and probably his brother.  He afterwards became king as Mahinda IV.  (956 72 A.C.).  He married a Kālinga princess.  During his reign, the Vallabha king invaded Ceylon, but was defeated by the general Sena and entered into a treaty with Mahinda.  Mahinda showed great favour to the Pamsukulikas and the Lābhavāsins and decreed that the incomes derived from vihāras should not be taxed.  His good acts were many.  He had a Commentary to the Abhidhamma written by the Thera Dhammamitta in the Sitthagāma-parivena and the Abhidhamma recited by the Thera Dāthānāga.[/p][p]He made great offerings at the Mahā Thūpa and started to build the Candanapāsāda, where he had preserved the Hair Relic of the Buddha.  He restored the temple of the four cetiyas in Padalañchana as well as the Temple of the Tooth, the Dhammasanganigeha and the Mahāpāli.  He built the Mahāmallaka for the Theravāda nuns and completed the Manipāsāda.  Mahinda's wife was Kittī (q.n), who, herself, engaged in various works.  Their son was Sena (Sena V.).

Mahinda escaped to Rohana by means of an underground passage, and lived at Sīdupabbatagāma with his brother's wife as queen, later marrying his brother's daughter.  Their son was Kassapa, and afterwards they lived in Kappagallaka.  In the thirty sixth year of Mahinda's reign, the Colas, taking advantage of the discontent in Ceylon, invaded the country, capturing the king, the queen, and all the royal regalia.  They ruled for many years with Pulatthinagara as base, and Mahinda died in Cola after a captivity lasting for twelve years (Cv.iv.1ff).  Lokitā and Devalā were his maternal cousins.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Manikantha Jātaka (No.  253)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta and his younger brother, after the death of their parents, lived as ascetics in leaf huts on the Ganges, the elder being higher up the stream than the younger.  One day, the Nāga king Manikantha, while walking along the river in the guise of a man, came to the hut of the younger ascetic and became his friend.  Thereafter he called daily and their friendship grew apace.  Manikantha finally became so fond of the ascetic that he put off his disguise, and encircling the other in his folds, lay thus for a short while each day, until his affection was satisfied.  But the ascetic was afraid of his Nāga shape and grew thin and pale.[/p][p]The Bodhisatta noticing this, suggested that the next time Manikantha came, his brother should ask for the jewel which he wore round his throat.  On the morrow, when the ascetic made this request, Manikantha hurried away.  Several times this happened, and then he came no more.  The ascetic was much grieved by his absence, but was comforted by the Bodhisiatta.[/p][p]The Buddha related this story at the Aggālava-cetiya near Alavi.  The monks of Alavi became so importunate with their requests for building materials from the householders that at the mere sight of a monk the householders would hurry indoors.  Mahā Kassapa discovered this and reported it to the Buddha, who admonished the monks against begging for things from other people.  J.ii.282 6; also Vin.iii.146f., where the details of the story of the past are slightly different.[/p][p]On the same occasion were preached the Brahmadatta Jātaka and the Atthisena Jātaka (q.v.).[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Mangala[/div][hr][ul][li][h4]1. Mangala[/h4][/li][/ul][p]The third of the twenty four Buddhas.[/p][p]He was born sixteen asankheyyas and one hundred thousand kappas ago in the Uttaramadhura Park, in the city of Uttara, his father being a khattiya named Uttara and his mother Uttarā.  It is said that from the day of her conception, an aura shed its rays night and day from her body, to a distance of eighty hands - hence his name.  He surpassed other Buddhas in glory of body.  In his last birth as a human being (corresponding to that of Vessantara in the case of Gotama) he lived with his family as an ascetic.  A man eating yakkha, named Kharadāthika, took from him his two children and ate them in his presence, "crunching them as though they were yams," while the blood dripped from his mouth.  (It is probably this incident, which is referred to at J.iv.13).  The Bodhisatta stood firm in his resolve and repented not of his gift to the yakkha, but registered a desire that in future births his body should emit light as bright as the blood which flowed down the yakkha's face.  In a previous birth, Mangala paid honour to the cetiya of a Buddha by wrapping his body in cloth drenched with oil, setting fire to it and walking round the cetiya throughout the night, carrying on his head a golden bowl filled with scented oil and lighted with one thousand wicks.  Not a hair on his body suffered damage.[/p][p]For nine thousand years Mangala lived in the household in three palaces, Yasavā, Sucimā and Sirimā, with his wife Yasavatī, by whom he had one son, Sīvala.  He left the world on a horse and practised austerities for eight months.  Just before his Enlightenment he ate a meal of milk rice given by a maiden, Uttarā, daughter of Uttarasetthi in Uttaragāma; an Ājīvaka, named Uttara, gave him grass for his seat.  His Bodhi was a Nāga tree.  After his Enlightenment he lived for ninety thousand years, and for all that time the aura from his body spread throughout the ten thousand world systems, shutting out sun, moon and stars.  People knew the times and the seasons by the cries of the birds and the blooming of the flowers.[/p][p]Mangala's first sermon was preached in the Sirivaruttama Grove, near Sirivaddha.  His chief disciples among men were Sudeva and Dhammasena, and his chief nuns Sīvalā and Asokā.  Pālita was his constant attendant (BuA.124 calls him Uttara).  Nanda and Visākha were his chief patrons among lay men and Anulā and Sutanā among lay women.  In Mangala's time the Bodhisatta was the brahmin Suruci (q.v.).  Mangala's body was eighty cubits high; he held three assemblies: the first at the preaching of the Dhammacakka, the second at Cittanagara, when he preached to Sunanda, king of Surabhinagara, and his son Anurāja, and the third at Mekhala to Sudeva and Dhammasena who later became his chief disciples.[/p][p]He died in the park of Vessara, and a cetiya, thirty leagues high, was erected over his ashes (Bu.iv.1ff.; BuA.115ff.; J.i.30 ff.; the particulars found in Mtu.i.248 50, are slightly different).

Mātali often accompanied Sakka on his journeys to the world of men, changing his form e.g., to that of a fish in the Culladhanuggaha Jātaka, a brahmin in the Bilārakosiya Jātaka and in the Suddhābhojana Jātaka, and a big black dog in the Mahākanha Jātaka.  On several occasions he was sent by Sakka to fetch human beings to Tāvatimsa e.g., Guttila, Nimi, Makhādeva and Sādhīna and he proved an excellent guide, pointing out to the visitors the places of interest passed on the way.[/p][p]When the Buddha descended from Tāvatimsa, after preaching there the Abhidhamma, he was accompanied, on the left, by Mātali, offering celestial scents, garlands and flowers (DhA.iii.226).  Both in the Bilārakosiya and the Sudhābhojana Jātakas (q.v.) Mātali is spoken of as the son of Suriya.  Ananda is said to have been Mātali during several lives (J.i.206; iv.180; v.  412; vi.129); so also Mahā Kassapa (J.iv.69).  In the Mahāsamaya Sutta (D.ii.258), Mātali is described as a Gandhabba chief, while in the Atānātiya Sutta (D.iii.204) he is mentioned among the chief Yakkhas to be invoked by followers of the Buddha in time of need.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Maricavatti[/div][p]A cetiya in Anurādhapura and a monastic building attached to it.  The cetiya was built by Dutthagāmanī on the spot where the king's spear, containing the Buddha's relic given to him by the monks (Mhv.xxv.1), was planted, when Dutthagāmanī went to the Tissavāpī for his ceremonial bathing after his consecration.  When the king's men attempted to remove the spear they found it impossible, and the king, after consultation with the monks, decided to build a cetiya enclosing the spot with a vihāra attached.  The work was completed in three years and a great ceremony of dedication was held, the building and the ceremony costing nineteen crores.  The vihāra was called Maricavatti because it was intended by the king as expiation for having once eaten a pepper pod (maricavatti) without sharing it with the monks, thus violating the vow of his childhood.  For the building of the vihāra, see Mhv.xxvi.1ff.; the vow is mentioned at Mhv.xxii.80; the Dpv.  makes no mention of Maricavatti.[/p][p]Vohārika Tissa renovated the vihāra (Mhv.xxxvi.33, 36), while Gothābhaya built an uposatha hall (Mhv.xxxvi.107) and Vasabha provided a mantling for the thūpa (Mhv.xxxv.121).[/p][p]Kassapa II.  built a pāsāda in the vihāra and gave it to the Thera who, at one time, lived in Nāgasālā (Cv.xliv.149).  Kassapa IV.  entrusted the care of the Bodhi tree at Maricavatti to the bhikkhunīs at the Tissārāma, which he built for them (Cv.lii.24), while Kassapa V.  restored the whole vihāra, gave it to the Theravādins and granted five hundred maintenance villages (Cv.lii.45).  Devā, mother of Sakkasenāpati, provided a diadem jewel for the Buddha image in the vihāra, also a halo, an umbrella and a garment (Cv.lii.65).  Dappula III.  gave a maintenance village to the vihāra (Cv.liii.2), while Mahinda IV.  started to build in it a pāsāda called Candana, which does not seem to have been completed (Cv.liv.40).  Parakkamabāhu I.  found the thūpa destroyed by the Damilas and rebuilt it to the height of eighty cubits (Cv.lxxviii.99).[/p]</e>

After the bath, the goat remembered its past lives and knew that after its death that day it would be free from misery.  So it laughed for joy.  But it saw also that the brahmin, through slaying it, would suffer great misery, and this thought made it weep.  On being questioned as to the reason for its laughing and its weeping, it said the answer would be given before the brahmin.  When the brahmin heard the goat's story, he resolved not to kill him; but that same day, while the goat was browsing near a rock, the rock was struck by lightning and a large splinter cut off the goat's head.  The Bodhisatta, who was a tree sprite, saw all this and preached the Law to the assembled multitude.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to a question by the monks as to whether there was any good at all in offering sacrifices as Feasts for the Dead, which the people of Sāvatthi were in the habit of doing.

Jātimā agreed to his staying, but, on finding that Mātanga was a candāla, he wished him to occupy a place apart.  During the night Mātanga wished to go out, and, not knowing where Jātimā was lying, trod on his chest.  When Mātanga returned he took the other way with the idea of passing near Jātimā's feet, but meanwhile Jātimā had changed his position, and Mātanga again trod on his chest.

The boy raised an axe, and meaning to drive away the mosquito, cleft his father's head in two, killing him.  The Bodhisatta, a trader, saw this incident.  " Better an enemy with sense than such a friend," said he.[/p][p]The story was related in reference to some inhabitants of a hamlet in Magadha who were worried by mosquitoes when working in the jungle.

[/p][p]He had the seven Jewels of a Cakka-vatti and his four Supernatural Powers.  When he clenched his left hand and touched it with his right, a shower of the seven kinds of jewels fell knee deep from the sky.  For eighty four thousand years he was a prince, for eighty four thousand a viceroy, and for eighty four thousand more a king.  His life span was an asankheyya.  But he grew discontented, and, at the suggestion of his ministers, visited the deva world.  First he went to the Cātummahārājika world, where he ruled; but still unsatisfied, he went to Tāvatimsa.  There Sakka welcomed him and gave him half his kingdom.  Mandhātā ruled there during the lifetime of thirty six Sakkas, each Sakka's life lasting for thirty six million years and sixty times one hundred thousand.  As time went on, Mandhātā's craving increased; he wished to kill Sakka and gain the whole kingdom.  Because of his greed his power waned, and he fell from heaven into his park.  The gardener announced his arrival to the royal family, and they provided a resting place for him and there he lay dying.  When asked for a message for his people, he wished them to know how even he, in spite of his great pomp and power, had to die (J.ii.311ff.; DA.ii.481f.; MA.i.182f.; cp.  Dvy.210ff).[/p][p]Mandhātā is identified with the Bodhisatta (J.ii.314).  His son was Varamandhātā, whose son was Cara and grandson Upacara (or Apacara) (J.iii.454; Dpv.iii.6).  Mandhātā ruled at Rājagaha (SNA.ii.413; DA.i.132), and is named as one of the four persons who attained, while yet in their earthly bodies, to the glory of the gods.  Mil.  115, 291; MA.ii.737f.; the others being Guttila, Sādhīna and Nimi.[/p][p]He is considered as chief of those given up to the pleasures of the senses and as an example of one whose desires could never be satisfied.

They thereupon begged for the intervention of the minister (Parināyaka), who was carrying on the government with Mandhātā's shoes on the throne.  He gave them lands in Jambudīpa.  There those who came from Pubba Videha called their land Videharattha; those from Apara goyāna called it Aparantajanapada, and those from Uttarakuru dwelt in what afterwards came to be known as Kururattha.

When the rightful heir, Vikkamabāhu, rose in revolt, Mānābharana seized from him Rohana and Dakkhinadesa and lived in Punkhagāma, under the name of Vīrabāhu (Cv.lxi.21ff).  He seems to have lived in constant conflict with Vikkamabāhu.  Later, when he had already two daughters, Mittā and Pabhāvatī, he gave over the government to his ministers and retired from the world.

Mānābharana reigned in Rohana as an independent king (Cv.lxvii.95).  When the throne was captured by Gajabāhu, Mānābharana tried several times to wrest it from him, but, failing in these attempts, made an alliance with Gajabāhu through the intervention of the monks; later, however, finding Parakkamabāhu growing in power, he went over to him (Cv.lxx.179ff).  When Gajabāhu was captured and detained at Pulatthinagara, the soldiers started to pillage the city, despite the orders of Parakkamabāhu.  The people were enraged and invited Mānābharana to come.  On his arrival at Pulatthipura, he captured Gajabāhu and threw him into a dungeon, seized all the treasures, including the Tooth Relic and Alms bowl, and took counsel with his mother to kill Gajabāhu.  On hearing of this, Parakkamabāhu sent his forces against Mānābharana and defeated the latter's followers at various places.  Mānābharana then fled to Rohana, taking with him some of the treasures (Cv.lxx.255ff).  From there he again tried to ally himself with Gajabāhu; but the latter did not so desire, though his ministers were in favor of it.  Relying on their support, Mānābharana advanced from Rohana.  He was, however, severely defeated at Pūnagāma and other places and Parakkamabāhu's forces assailed him from all sides.  The campaign brought varying success to the opposing armies, and Mānābharana proved a skilful warrior.  He was helped by various chieftains and fought bitterly and valiantly to the end (for details see Cv.lxxii.148 309), but, as he lay dying, he summoned his children and ministers and counseled them to join Parakkamabāhu.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Maccharikosiya[/div][hr][p][b]1. Maccharikosiya.[/b] A setthi, worth eighty crores, of Sakkhara near Rājagaha.  His real name was Kosiya, but as he was too miserly to give away even a drop of oil, he came to be called Maccharikosiya.  One day, when returning from the palace, he saw a half starved yokel eating a round cake filled with sour gruel.  The sight made him hungry, but fearing to spend his money, he told no one, but lay on his bed in great distress, till his wife found him.  Having discovered the reason for his misery, she said she would bake cakes sufficient for everyone in Sakkhara.  "But that would be such extravagance," said Kosiya, and persuaded his wife to bake just one cake, using only broken grains of rice.  Fearful lest someone should ask for a piece of his cake, he retired with her to the seventh storey of his house and there made her start the cooking after bolting all the doors.[/p][p]The Buddha saw him with his divine eye and sent Moggallāna to him; Moggallāna stood poised in mid air just outside Kosiya's window and indicated his wish to have something to eat, but Kosiya blustered and threatened, and, after refusing to give him anything, bade his wife cook another little cake for him.  But each cake she baked grew bigger than the previous one, and when she tried to take a single cake from the basket, they all stuck together.  In despair, Kosiya presented cakes and basket to the Elder.  Moggallāna then preached on the importance of generosity, and transported Kosiya, his wife and the cakes to Jetavana.  There the cakes were offered to the Buddha and five hundred monks, and even after they had all eaten, there was no end to the cakes.  The spot where the remaining ones were thrown away at the gates of Jetavana was known as Kapallapūvapabbhāra.  The Buddha preached to Kosiya and his wife and they became sotāpannas.  Kosiya then spent all his wealth in the service of the Buddha and his religion.  It was in reference to him that the Illīsa Jātaka was preached, Illīsa being identified with Maccharikosiya.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Mangala Jātaka (No.  87).  [/div][p]The Bodhisatta was once an Udicca-brahmin who, having entered the ascetic life, lived in Himavā.  He one day visited Rājagaha, and the king invited him to stay in the Royal Park.  While he was there, a brahmin who believed in omens as shown by clothes (Dussalakkhana brāhmana) found a garment in his chest which had been gnawed by mice, and, fearing disaster, wished to have it thrown out into the charnel ground.  Unwilling to entrust the job to anyone else, he gave the clothes to his son to throw away.  The Bodhisatta saw the garment and picked it up in spite of the grave warnings of the old brahmin, saying that no wise man should believe in omens.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to a superstitious brahmin of Rājagaha who had his clothes thrown away in the manner related above.  The Buddha was waiting in the charnel field and picked up the garments.  When the brahmin protested, he related to him the story and preached to him on the folly of paying heed to superstitions.  At the end of the sermon, father and son became sotāpannas.  The characters in both stories are the same.  J.i.371ff.[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Makkata Sutta[/div][p]In certain tracts of the Himālaya where monkeys resort, hunters set up traps of pitch to catch the monkeys.  Wise monkeys avoid the traps, but the foolish ones handle the pitch and their paws stick in it, one after another, and finally their muzzles, in their struggles to escape.  So it is with foolish men who allow their senses to roam in wrong pastures - the objects of the senses.  S.v.148.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Mallā[/div][p]The name of a people and their country.  [/p][p]The country is included in the sixteen  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahajanapada,Mahājanapadas')"]Mahājanapadas[/a] of the Buddha's time.  The kingdom, at that time, was divided into two parts, having their respective capitals in [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pava,Pāvā')"]Pāvā[/a] and  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kusinaaraa,Kusinārā')"]Kusinārā[/a].  The Mallas of Pāvā were called Pāveyyaka Mallā, those of Kusināra, Kosinārakā.  That these were separate kingdoms is shown by the fact that after the Buddha's death at Kusināra, the Mallas of Pāvā sent messengers to claim their share of the Buddha's relics (D.ii.165).  Each had their Mote Hall.  [/p][p]In the Sangīti Sutta we are told that the Buddha, in the course of one of his journeys, came with five hundred followers to Pāvā and stayed in the Ambavana of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cunda,Cunda')"]Cunda[/a] the smith.  A new Mote Hall, called Ubbhataka, had just been completed for the Mallas of Pāvā, and the Buddha was invited to be the first to occupy it that it might be consecrated thereby.  The Buddha accepted the invitation, and preached in the Hall far into the night.  It was also at Pāvā that the Buddha took his last meal, of Sūkaramaddava, at the house of Cunda (D.ii.126f).  From there he went to Kusinārā, and there, as he lay dying, he sent  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda,Ananda')"]Ananda[/a] to the Mallas of Kusināra, who were assembled in their Mote Hall to announce his approaching death.  The Mallas thereupon came to the Upavattana Sāla grove where the Buddha was, in order to pay him their last respects.  Ananda made them stand in groups according to family, and then presented them to the Buddha, announcing the name of each family.  After the Buddha's death, they met together once more in the Mote Hall, and made arrangements to pay him all the honour due to a [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cakkavatti,Cakkavatti')"]Cakkavatti[/a].  They cremated the Buddha's body at the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/makutabandhana,Makutabandhana')"]Makutabandhana[/a] cetiya, and then collected the relics, which they deposited in their Mote Hall, surrounding them with a lattice work of spears and a rampart of bows till they were distributed among the various claimants by Dona (D.ii.166).  The Mallas, both of Pāvā and Kusināra, erected thūpas over their respective shares of the relics and held feasts in their honour (D.ii.167).[/p][p]The Malla capital of Kujsinārā was, in the Buddha's day, a place of small importance.  Ananda contemptuously refers to it as a "little wattle and daub town in the midst of a jungle, a branch township," quite unworthy of being the scene of the Buddha's Parinibbāna.  But the Buddha informs Ananda that it was once Kusāvatī (q.v.), the mighty capital of Kusa and Mahāsudassana.  This shows that the Mallas had, at first, a monarchical constitution, but in the sixth century B.C.  they were regarded, together with the Vajjis, as a typical example of a republic (sangha, gana) (M.i.231).  The chief Mallas administered the state in turn.  Those who were free from such duties engaged in trade, sometimes undertaking long caravan journeys (DA.ii.569).[/p][p]Both the Buddha and Nigantha Nātaputta appear to have had followers among the Mallas.  Pāvā was the scene of Nātaputta's death, just as Kusinārā was of the Buddha's (see Pāvā).  Several followers of the Buddha among the Mallas are mentioned by name - e.g., Dabba, Pukkusa, Khandasumana, Bhadragaka, Rāsiya, Roja and Sīha (q.v.).  The Mallas seem to have lived at peace with their neighbours, though there was apparently some trouble between them and the Licchavis, as shown by the story of Bandhula Malla (q.v.).  Both the Mallas and the Licchavis were khattiyas, belonging to the Vasittha gotta, because in the books both tribes are repeatedly referred to as Vāsetthā (q.v.).  Manu says that both Licchavis and Mallas had ksatriya parents, but their fathers were Vrātyas - i.e., had not gone through the ceremony of Vedic initiation at the proper time.  [/p][p]There is reason to believe that the Malla republic fell into the hands of Ajātasattu, as did that of the Licchavis (Bhandarkar, Carmichael Lectures, 1918, p.79).[/p][p]The Mallas are generally identified with the Malloi mentioned in the Greek accounts of Alexander's invasion of India.  The Malloi were a warlike tribe who, for some time, successfully resisted Alexander's attack.  Their territory must have been situated in or near the Panjab.[/p][p]Other places in the Malla country, besides Pāvā and Kusinārā, are mentioned where the Buddha stayed - e.g., Bhoganagara, Anupiyā and Uruvelakappa, near which was the Mahāvana, a wide tract of forest.[/p][p]Bandhula went from Kusināra to Takkasilā for purposes of study.  v.l.

Keka is mentioned as the capital of Mahimsaka, where a king named Ajjuna once ruled (J.v.145) also a city, called Sakula, capital of King Sakula.  Near Sakula was a lake, called Mānusiya (J.v.337).  In the Bhīmasena Jātaka (J.i.356) the Bodhisatta is mentioned as living for some time in Mahimsaka in his birth as Cūladhanuggaha pandita.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Macchuddāna Jātaka (No.  288)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta was once the son of a landed proprietor, and, after his father's death, he and his younger brother went to a village to settle some business.  On their way back, they had a meal out of a leaf bottle, and, when they had finished, the Bodhisatta threw the remains into the river for the fish, giving the merit to the river spirit.  The power of the river spirit increased and she discovered the cause.  The younger brother was of a dishonest disposition, and when the elder was asleep, he packed a parcel of gravel to resemble the money they were carrying and put them both away.  While they were in mid river he stumbled against the side of the boat and dropped overboard what he thought to be the parcel of gravel, but what was really the money.  He told the Bodhisatta about it who said, "Never mind, what's gone has gone." But the river spirit out of gratitude to the Bodhisatta made a fish swallow the parcel.  The fish was later caught and hawked about, and, owing again to the influence of the spirit, the fisherman asked one thousand pieces and seven annas for it, and the people laughed at what they thought was a joke.  But when they came to the Bodhisatta's house, they offered him the fish for seven annas.  The fish was bought and cut open by his wife, and the money was given to him.  At that instant the river spirit informed him of what she had done and asked him to have no consideration for his brother, who was a thief and was greatly disappointed at the failure of his trick.

There is no such thing as power or energy or human strength or human vigour.  All beings (sattā), all lives (pānā), all existent things (bhūtā), all living substances (jīvā), (*2) are bent this way and that by their fate, by the necessary conditions of the class to which they belong, by their individual nature; it is according to their position in one or other of the six classes (abhijāti) that they experience ease or pain.

But the explanation is very confused and makes the terms by no means mutually exclusive.[/p][p](*3) Buddhaghosa gives them as babyhood, playtime, trial time, erect time, learning time, ascetic time, prophet time, and prostrate time, with (very necessary) comments on each.[/p][/blockquote][p][/p][p]There are eighty four thousand periods during which both fools and wise alike, wandering in transmigration, shall at last make an end of pain.  This cannot be done by virtue, or penance, or righteousness.  Ease and pain, measured out as it were with a measure, cannot be altered in the course of transmigration (samsāra); there can be neither increase nor decrease thereof both fools and wise alike, wandering in transmigration, exactly for the allotted term, shall then, and then only, make an end of pain.[/p][p]Makkhali's views as given in the Buddhist books are difficult to understand, the Commentators themselves finding it a hopeless task.  He seems to have believed in infinite gradations of existence; in his view, each individual thing has eternal existence, if not individually, at least in type.  He evidently had definite conceptions of numerous grades of beings, celestial, infernal and mundane, as also of the infinity of time and the recurrent cycles of existence.  He seems to have conceived the world as a system in which everything has a place and a function assigned to it, a system in which chance has no place and which admits of no other cause whatever, of the depravity or purity of beings, but that which is implied in the word Fate or Destiny (niyati).  All types of things and all species of beings, however, are individually capable of transformation that is of elevation or degradation in type.  His theory of purification through transmigration (samsārasuddhi) probably meant perfection through transformation (parinatā) - transformation which implies not only the process of constant change, but also a fixed orderly mode of progression and retrogression.  All things must, in course of time, attain perfection (for a discussion on Makkhali and his doctrines see Barua: Pre buddhistic Indian Philosophy, 297ff).  Makkhali's followers are known as the Ājīvakas (q.v.).[/p][p]According to the books, the Buddha considered Makkhali as the most dangerous of the heretical teachers: "I know not of any other single person fraught with such loss to many folk, such discomfort, such sorrow to devas and men, as Makkhali, the infatuate (A.i.33).  The Buddha also considered his view the meanest - just as the hair blanket is reckoned the meanest of all woven garments, even so, of all the teachings of recluses, that of Makkhali is the meanest (A.i.286).  Buddhaghosa (DA.i.166f) draws particular distinction between the moral effect of Makkhali's doctrine on the one hand and that of the doctrines of Pūrana Kassapa and Ajita on the other.  Pūrana, by his theory of the passivity of the soul, denied action; Ajita, by his annihilationistic theory denied retribution; whereas Makkhali, by his doctrine of fate or non causation, denied both action and its result.[/p][p]Very little is known of the name and the life of Makkhali.  The Buddhist records call him Makkhali Gosāla.  Buddhaghosa explains (DA.i.143f; MA.i.422) that he was once employed as a servant; one day, while carrying an oil-pot along a muddy road, he slipped and fell through carelessness, although warned thus by his master: "Mā khali," (stumble not) - hence his name.  When he found that the oil pot was broken, he fled; his master chased him and caught him by his garment, but he left it and ran along naked.  He was; called Gosāla, because he was born in a cow shed.  According to Jaina records (e.g.  Uvāsaga-dasāo, p.1), he is called Gosāla Mankhaliputta; he was born at Saravana near Sāvatthi, his father's name being Mankhali and his mother's Bhaddā.  His father was a Mankha i.e., a dealer in pictures- and Gosāla followed this profession until he became a monk.[/p][p]The philosopher's true name (Barua, op.  cit., 298) seems to have been Maskarin, the Jaina Prakrit form of which is Mankhali and the Pāli form Makkhali.  "Maskarin" is explained by Pāninī (VI.i.154) as "one who carries a bamboo staff" (maskara).  A Maskarin is also known as Ekadandin.  According to Patañjali (Mahābhāsya iii.96), the name indicates a School of Wanderers who were called Maskarins, not so much because they carried a bamboo staff as because they denied the freedom of the will.  The Maskarins were thus fatalists or determinists.[/p]</e>

Māgandiya expresses the view that purity comes from philosophy, from disputations and discussions, learning and.  austerities.  The Buddha denies this, and says that purity comes from inward peace.  The sage (muni) is a confessor of peace and does not indulge in disputes.  SN.  vs.  835 47.[/p][p][b]2. Māgandiya Sutta.[/b] Records the conversation between the Buddha and the paribbājaka Māgandiya.  Māgandiya says the Buddha is a repressionist (bhunahu) and this the Buddha denies, saying that he teaches only the subjugation of the senses, knowing their origin and their cessation; he has discarded all craving after them and dwells with his heart at peace.  He then relates how, in his youth, he had enjoyed the greatest and most luxurious kinds of sensuous pleasures and had renounced them.  He could no more crave for them than a leper, cured of his disease, craves for his old sores.  Both the Buddha and teachers of other persuasions are convinced that health is the greatest boon and Nibbāna the highest bliss.  But the Buddha's conception of health and Nibbāna differs from that of other teachers.  Their knowledge is as that of a blind man, taken on trust.  Māgandiya listens and is convinced.  He enters the Order and becomes an arahant.  M.i.501 13; Thomas: op.  cit., 115.[/p]</e>

All these friends used to eat at his house, where they were well looked after.  But the wife died, and they all lamented greatly.  The Buddha heard of this, and sent for them and recited to them the Kāka Jātaka (q.v.) (J.i.497ff).  At the end of the discourse the aged monks all became sotāpannas.  DhA.iii.422ff.[/p]</e>

Mtu.ii.441f).  [/p][p]In the similar story of Anitthigandha, a prince of Benares contracts a marriage with a daughter of the king of Sāgala his name being Maddava; but the girl dies on the way to her husband.  (SNA.i.68f.; cp.  DhA.iii.281, about the other Anitthigandha of Sāvatthi of the Buddha's days, who also married a Madda princess).  [/p][p]The Chaddanta Jātaka also mentions a matrimonial alliance between the royal houses of Benares and Sāgala, while in the Kālingabodhi Jātaka (J.iv.230f ) the Madda king's daughter marries a prince of Kālinga while both are in exile.  [/p][p]J.v.39f.; so also in the Mūgapakkha Jātaka (J.vi.1), the wife of the Kāsi king was the daughter of the king of Madda, Candadevi by name; while Phusatī, wife of Sañjaya of Jetuttara in the Sivi kingdom and mother of Vessantara, was also a Madda princess (J.vi.480); likewise Maddī, wife of Vessantara.[/p][p]Cūlani, son of Talatā, also married a princess of Madda (J.vi.471).  According to the Mahāvamsa (Mhv.viii.7; this probably refers to Madras and not to the Madda country, whose capital was Sāgala), Sumitta, son of Sīhabāhu and king of Sīhapura, married the daughter of the Madda king and had three sons by him, the youngest of whom, Panduvāsudeva, became king of Ceylon.[/p][p]Bhaddā Kāpilānī wife of Pippalimānava (Mahā Kassapa), was the daughter of a Kosiyagotta brahmin of Sāgala in the Madda country.  Men went there in search of a wife for him because it was famed for the beauty of its women (Maddarattham nāma itthāgāro) (ThagA.ii.142; ThigA.68).  Anojā, wife ofMahā Kappina of Kukkutavatī, also came from the royal household of Madda (DhA.ii.116), as did Khemā, wife of Bimbisāra (ThigA.127).[/p][p]The wife of a Cakkavattī comes either from Uttarakuru or from the royal family of Madda (MA.ii.950; DA.ii.626; KhA.173).[/p][p]For the identification of Madda see Sāgala.[/p]</e>

The son wished to admit him, but the Bodhisatta recognised the monkey and drove him a way.

In her previous life she was married to a householder of Sāvatthi, but, because she was barren, her husband married another woman, named Tissā, by whom he had a child called Bhūta.  One day, when Tissā and her husband were talking together, Mattā was seized with jealousy and threw a heap of dirt on Tissā's head.  After death, Mattā was born as a petī and suffered grievously.

As a result of this gift she became the queen of Vankanāsikatissa.  Later she bought the piece of land for one thousand and built there the vihāra.  Gajabāhukagāmanī built a stone thūpa connected with it and gave lands to the monks of the vihāra (Mhv.xxxiii.104ff., 115ff).  The full name of this vihāra seems to have been Rājamātuvihāra (q.v.).

They held that the truth of nirodha had two aspects (Kvu.ii.11; see also viii.9; xviii.6; xix.8; xx.5; and Rockhill, op.  cit., 182-186, 191-192).

  <e>[div class="huge"]Mamsa Jātaka (No.  315)[/div][p]The four sons of four rich merchants of Benares were once sitting at the cross roads, and, seeing a deer stalker hawking venison in a cart, one of them proposed to get some flesh from him.  So he went up to the man and said, " Hi! My man! Give me some meat," and the hunter gave him some skin and bone; the second, going up to him addressed him as "Elder Brother" and was given a joint; but the third cajoled him, calling him "Father," and received a savoury piece of meat; while the fourth (the Bodhisatta) addressed him as "Friend," and was given the whole of the rest of the deer, and the meat was conveyed to his house in the man's cart.[/p][p]The story was related in reference to Sāriputta.  Some monks of Jetavana, having taken oil as a purgative, wished for some dainty food.  They sent their attendants to beg in the cooks' quarters, but these had to come back empty handed.  Sāriputta met them, and, having heard their story, returned with them to the same street; the people gave him a full measure of dainty fare, which was distributed among the sick monks.

He related the stories of Vāsudeva and Jambāvatī and of Vaccha and Rattavatī, to prove that husband and wife need not be equal in birth.

After the Buddha's departure the monks seek Mahā Kaccāna and ask him to expound in detail what the Buddha has told them in brief.  Kaccāna explains that where there is eye and visible form, visual consciousness arises, this begets contact, contact conditions feeling, what a man feels he perceives, what he perceives he reasons about, and this leads to obsession.  It is the same with the other senses.  The monks report this explanation to the Buddha, who approves of it and praises Kaccāna's earning and insight.  Ananda praises the discourse, comparing it to a honeyed pill of delicious savour, and the Buddha suggests that the sutta should be remembered by that name (Madhupindika) (M.i.108-14).[/p][p]Nāgita was; among those present when the sutta was preached.

One day he met a forester who had lost his way, and, feeling sorry for him, the elephant set him on the right path, carrying him on his back.  But the forester was wicked, and, on his return to Benares, told the king about the elephant.  The king asked him to fetch the elephant, who, seeing the forester approaching, meekly followed him lest his virtue be impaired.  The elephant was received in the city with great pomp and placed in the royal stables as the state elephant, but he would touch no morsel of food.  The king enquired into this and learnt of the elephant's blind mother.  Thereupon the elephant was set free, and returned to the Himālaya amid the applause of the people.  The king built a town near the elephant's dwelling, where he showed him great honour, and later, when, at his mother's death, the elephant went away to the Karandaka monastery to wait on the ascetics there, the king did the same for them.[/p][p]The story was related in reference to a monk who tended his mother.  For details see the Sāma Jātaka.  Ananda is identified with the king, whose name is given as Vedeha, and Mahāmāyā with the mother-elephant (J.iv.90 5).[/p][p]The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iv.13) calls this the Mātuposaka NāgarājaJātaka and gives the name of the elephant as Dhanapāla.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Manicora Jātaka (No.  194)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta was once a householder in a village near Benares and he had a most beautiful wife, named Sujātā.  One day, at her request, they prepared some sweetmeats, and, placing them in a cart, started for Benares to see her patents.  On the way Sujātā was seen by the king of Benares, and, wishing to possess her, he ordered the jewel of his diadem to be introduced into the Bodhisatta's cart.  The cry of " thief " was then set up, and the Bodhisatta arrested and taken off to be executed.  But Sakkas throne was heated by Sujātā's lamentations, and, descending to earth, Sakka made the king and the Bodhisatta change places.  The king was beheaded, and Sakka, revealing himself, set the Bodhisatta on the throne.[/p][p]The story was related in reference to Devatattas attempts to kill the Buddha.  The king is identified with Devadatta, Sakka with Anuruddha, and Rāhulamātā with Sujātā (J.ii.121 5).  The story gives the case of a man getting happiness through a virtuous woman.  J.iv.77.[/p]</e>

It could be seen from the Indasāla guhā (ThagA.i.333).  The contour of the field struck the Buddha's imagination and he asked Ananda to design a robe of the same pattern.  Ananda did this very successfully, and this pattern has been adopted for the robes of members of the Order ever since (Vin.i.287).[/p][p]The Suvannnakakkata Jātaka (J.iii.293; also iv.277) mentions a field of one thousand karīsas (about eight thousand acres) in a brahmin village called SāIindiya to the east of Rājagaha.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Mahiyangana[/div][p]A locality in the old Mahānāga garden, on the banks of the Mahāvālukagangā.  It was there that the Buddha hovered in the air on his first visit to Ceylon, in order to frighten the Yakkhas.  Later, Mahāsumana built there a shrine seven cubits in diameter, all of sapphire, and containing the hair given to him by the Buddha.  After the Buddha's death, Sarabhū, a disciple of Sāriputta, brought there the collar bone of the Buddha, which he deposited in the thūpa, increasing the height of the thūpa to twelve cubits.  Uddhacūlābhaya raised it to thirty cubits, while Dutthagāmanī, dwelling there during his campaign against the Damila Chatta, increased it to eighty cubits (Mhv.i.24, 33ff.; xxv.7; Cv.  Trs.i.154, n.3).  Vohārika Tissa erected a parasol over the thūpa (Mhv.xxxvi.34).  Attached to the thūpa was a vihāra, near which lived the three Lambakannas, Sanghatissa, Sanghabodhi and Gothābhaya (Mhv.xxxvi.58).[/p][p]In later times, Sena II.  gave maintenance villages to the vihāra (Cv.li.74), as did also Kassapa IV.  (Cv.lii.14).  Vijayabāhu I.  found the vihāra in a bad state of decay and had it restored, (Cv.lx.59) while Parakkamabāhu VI.  carried out repairs to the thūpa (Cv.xci.29).  King Vīravikamma went from his capital to Mahiyangana, a distance of seven gāvutas on foot, and held a great festival in honour of the thūpa (Cv.xcii.17).  King Narindasīha is mentioned as having visited Mahiyangana three times once alone and twice with his army and as having held magnificent festivals in its honour (Cv.xcvii.27ff).  Vijayarājasīha held a festival there (Cv.xcviii.85), as did Kittisirirājasīha, who made a pilgrimage to the spot (Cv.xcix.38); he also made arrangements for travelers from Siam to Ceylon to visit the spot and hold celebrations there (Cv.c.125ff).

  <e>[div class="huge"]Mayhaka Jātaka (No.  390)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta was once born in a very wealthy family, and he built an alms hall and gave away generously.  He married, and, on the birth of a son, he entrusted wife and child to his younger brother and became an ascetic.  When the boy began to grow up, the brother drowned him in the river lest he should claim half the estate.  The Bodhisatta saw this with his divine eye and called on his brother, to whom he pointed out the folly of covetousness - “You are like the bird, Mayhaka, who sits on the pipal tree and keeps on crying 'Mine, mine,' while the other birds eat the fruit."[/p][p]The story was told in reference to a wealthy man of Sāvatthi, a stranger who settled down there.  He neither enjoyed his wealth nor gave it to others, living in poverty, eating rice dust and sour gruel, and travelling in a broken down chariot with a parasol of leaves.  He died without issue and his money, passed to the king.  When the king told the Buddha of this, the Buddha explained to him that the miser had, in a previous birth, met the Pacceka Buddha Tagarasikhī begging for alms and had sent word to his wife to give the food prepared for himself.  This the wife gladly did.  But the man saw Tagarasikhī with his bowl full of sweet foods and repented of his generosity.  Therefore, in this birth, though possessing much wealth, he never enjoyed it.  He was childless because he was the very man who had drowned the Bodhisatta's son.  J.iii.299-303.[/p]</e>

As the Buddha suffered much from loss of blood, the monks took him on a litter to Maddakucchi, and from there to the Jīvaka-ambavana, where he was treated by Jivaka (Vin.ii.193f.; DhA.ii.164ff.; J.iv.430; Mil.179).

She went into the park unknown to the king and violently massaged her womb, but without success.

One day, while going for alms in Kallagāma, near by, he was invited by an upāsikā to her dwelling, where she gave him a meal, and, regarding him as a son, invited him to take all his meals at her home.  The invitation was accepted, and each day, after the meal, he would return thanks with the words "May you be happy and free from sorrow" (sukham hotu, dukkhā mucca).  At the end of the rainy season he became an arahant, and the chief incumbent of the Vihāra entrusted him with the task of preaching to the assembled people on the Pavārana Day.  The young novices informed the upāsikā that her "son" would preach that day, but she, thinking they were making fun of her, said that not everyone could preach.  But they persuaded her to go to the vihāra, and, when the turn of Maliyadeva came, he preached all through the night.  At dawn he stopped, and the upāsikā became a sotāpanna.[/p][p]Maliyadeva once preached the Cha Chakka Sutta in the Lohāpāsāda, and sixty monks, who listened to him, became arahants.

At Cittalapabbata he saw a monk of over sixty preparing to bathe at Kuruvakatittha, and asked permission to bathe him.  The Elder, discovering from his conversation that he was Maliyadeva, agreed to let him do so, though, he said, no one had ever touched his body during sixty years.  Later in the day, the Elder begged Maliyadeva to preach to him, and this he did.  Sixty monks, all over sixty, were among the audience, and at the conclusion of the Cha Chakka Sutta they all became arahants.  The same thing happened at Tissamahāvihāra, Kalyāni vihāra, Nāgamahāvihara, Kalacchagāma, and at other places, sixty in all (MA.ii.1024f).[/p][p]Malaya Mahādeva was among those various large groups who renounced the world in the company of the Bodhisatta: the Kuddālasamāgama, Mūgapakkha samāgama, Cūlasutasoma samāgama, Ayogharapandita samāgama and Hatthipāla samāgama (J.iv.490; also vi.30, where Mahāmaliyadeva is called Kālavelavāsī).

  <e>[div class="huge"]Majjhantika Thera[/div][p]An arahant.  He recited the kammavācā (or ecclesiastical act) at the ordination of Mahinda, on whom he later conferred the upasampadā ordination (Mhv.v.207; Sp.i.51; Dpv.vii.24).  Later, at the conclusion of the Third Council, Majjhantika went as preacher to Kasmīra Gandhāra.  There, by his great iddhi powers, he overcame the Nāga king Aravāla and converted him to the Faith, while Pandaka and his wife Hāritā and their five hundred sons became sotāpannas.  Majjhantika preached the Āsīvisopama Sutta to the assembled concourse and later ordained one hundred thousand persons (Mhv.xii.3, 9ff.; Sp.i.64ff.; Dpv.viii.4; Mbv.113; for the Tibetan version see Rockhill, op.  cit., 167ff.).  The sermon preached by Majjhantika is referred to in the Scholiast to the Sarabhanga Jātaka (J.v.142).[/p][p]This same Elder is referred to elsewhere as an example of one who practised pariyatti appicchatā (SNA.ii.494; DA.iii.1061, but at AA.i.263 he is called Majjhantika Tissa).  He was the leader of the assembly of monks (sanghathera).  On the day of the dedication of Asoka's vihāra, the Thera was a khīnāsava and was present, but his begging bowl and robe were hardly worth a farthing.  People, seeing him there, asked him to make way; but he sank into the earth, rising to receive the alms given to the leader of the monks, knowing that he alone was fit to accept it.  The story is given at AA.i.43; MA.i.350.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Mattakundali, Matthakundali[/div][p]The only son of the brahmin Adinnapubbaka.  His father loved him dearly, but was a great miser, and made for him, with his own hands, a pair of burnished ear rings in order to save the goldsmith's fee; the boy thus came to be called Mattakundali (burnished ear rings).  When he was sixteen he had an attack of jaundice.  His father refused to call in a physician, and prescribed for him himself till the boy was beyond all cure.  Then he carried him out and laid him on the terrace, lest those who came to prepare for the funeral should see his wealth.[/p][p]The Buddha saw Mattakundali as he lay dying, and, out of compassion, came to the door of his father's house.  Too weak to do anything else, the boy conjured up devout faith in the Buddha; he died soon after, and was born among the gods in a golden mansion thirty leagues in extent.  When he surveyed his past birth, he saw his father in the charnel ground, weeping and lamenting and preparing to cremate his body.  Assuming the form of Mattakundali, he went himself to the charnel ground and, standing near, started to weep.  When questioned by Adinnapubbaka, he said he wanted the moon, and in the course of conversation he revealed his identity and censured his father.  Adinnapubbaka invited the Buddha to a meal the next day, and, when it was over, asked if it were possible to attain to heaven by a mere act of faith.  In order to convince him, the Buddha made Mattakundali appear before him and confirm his statement that this was so.  At the conclusion of the Buddha's sermon, both Adinnapubbaka and Mattakundali became sotāpannas, and eighty thousand persons realized the Truth (Mil.350).

She was offered in marriage to anyone who could sing a reply to her song.  Erakapatta hoped thereby to become aware of it when a Buddha should appear in the world.  Many suitors came, and an interval between two Buddhas passed and still no one was successful.  At last a young brahmin, Uttara (q.v.), well-schooled for the task by the Buddha, appeared before the[/p][p]Nāga-maiden and answered all her questions.  (Uttara himself became a sotāpanna when he finished learning his lesson from the Buddha.) Erakapatta at once knew that a Buddha had come, and asked Uttara to take him to the Teacher.  At the sight of the Buddha, Erakapatta was seized with great sorrow on account of his condition, but the Buddha preached to him and consoled him.  It is said that the Nāga king would have attained the Fruit of Conversion had it not been for his animal nature.  DhA.iii.230-6.[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Ekuddāna (Ekuddāniya) Thera[/div][p]An arahant.  He was the son of a wealthy brahmin of Sāvatthi, and being convinced of the Buddha's majesty, as seen at the presentation of the Jetavana, he entered the Order.  He dwelt in the forest fulfilling his novitiate, and once came to the Buddha to learn of him.  The Buddha, seeing Sāriputta near him wrapt in contemplation, uttered a stanza, that to the monk of lofty thoughts and heedful, sorrow comes not (See Dhammapada, 259).  The monk learnt this stanza, and returning to the forest, ever and anon reflected on it.  He thus came to be called Ekuddāniya.  One day he obtained insight and became an arahant.  Later, when Ananda asked him to preach a sermon, it was this stanza that he took as his text.[/p][p]We are told that in the time of Atthadassī Buddha he was a chief of the yakkhas, and when the Buddha died he went about lamenting that he had not made use of his opportunities.  A disciple of the Buddha, named Sāgara, meeting him, advised him to make offering to the Buddha's thūpa.  In Kassapa's time he was a householder, and heard the Buddha utter the stanza mentioned above.  He entered the Order, and for twenty thousand years practised meditation, repeating the stanza, but gained no attainment (ThagA.i.153f; Thag.v.68).[/p][p][/p][p]It is said (DhA.iii.384f) that on fast-days Ekuddāna, alone in the forest, sounded the call for the deities of the forest to attend the preaching of the Law, and uttered his stanza, whereupon the deities made loud applause.  One fast-day two monks, versed in the Tipitaka, visited Ekuddāna with a retinue of five hundred each.  Seeing them, Ekuddāna's heart was glad and he said: "Today we will listen to the Law." On being asked for an explanation, he described how, when the Dhamma was expounded, the forest grove was filled with the applause of devas.  Thereupon one of the Elders recited the Dhamma and the other expounded it, but there was no sound.  In order to dispel their doubts, Ekuddāna took his seat and pronounced his one stanza.  The sound of the plaudits of the devas filled the forest.  The Elders were greatly offended at the conduct of the devas and complained to the Buddha.  The Buddha explained to them that the important thing was not the amount of knowledge but the quality of the understanding.[/p][p][/p][p]It is noteworthy that the verse, attributed above to Ekuddāniya, occurs in the Vinaya (Vin.iv.54) as having been constantly used by Cūlapanthaka.  Whenever it was his turn to preach to the nuns at Sāvatthi they expected no effective lesson, since he always repeated the same stanza, namely, that which is above attributed to Ekuddāniya.  The thera, bearing of their remarks, forthwith gives an exhibition of his iddhi-power and of his knowledge of the Dhamma, thereby winning their tribute of admiration.[/p]</e>

Ordinarily he was a deva like the others, because there are no animals in the deva-world, but when they went to the park to play, Erāvana assumed the form of an elephant, one hundred and fifty leagues in size.  For the thirty-three devas Erāvana erected thirty-three heads (kumbha), each two or three quarters of a league in girth.  Each head had seven tusks, each fifty leagues long, each tusk bore seven lotus plants, each plant seven flowers, each flower seven leaves, and on each leaf danced seven nymphs (Padumaceharā).  For Sakka himself there was a special head, Sudassana, thirty leagues around, above it a canopy of twelve leagues all of precious stones.

Although an unbeliever, he paid the greatest respect to Buddhism, and he is credited with having persuaded the gods, by his determination, to send rain over his kingdom only at convenient times.  Elāra had a general named Mitta (Mhv.xxiii.4); the chief of his forces was Dīghajantu, while his royal elephant was called Mahāpabbata.  In the great battle between Elāra's forces and the Sinhalese soldiers under Dutthagāmanī, Elāra was slain in single contest with the latter.  In recognition of the dead king's chivalry, great honours were paid to him at his funeral and a monument was erected over his ashes.  For many generations all music was stopped while passing the monument as a mark of respect to the honoured dead (Mhv.xxv.54-74; Dpv.xxiii.49ff).[/p][p]According to the Mahāvamsa Tīkā (p.  483), a shrine was erected on the spot where Elāra's ashes were buried, and it was called the Elārapatimāghara.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Ekasātaka[/div][p]A very poor brahmin who lived in the time of Vipassī Buddha.  He was so called because he and his wife had, between them, only one upper garment, worn by whichever of them happened to be going out.  The Buddha was in the habit of preaching every seven years.  On one such occasion the brahmin listened to the Buddha's sermon, and being greatly pleased, wishing to make an offering, he gave the Buddha his upper garment after a hard mental struggle as to whether he could afford the gift.  Having made the gift, he shouted with joy saying, "I have won." The king of the city, Bandhumā, having heard the shout and learnt the reason, gave to the brahmin various rich gifts, including the sabbatthaka (*), all of which the latter presented to the Buddha, keeping, at the king's special request, a single pair of garments for himself and his wife.  The king later made Ekasātaka his chaplain (AA.i.92ff; also ThagA.ii.136).[/p][p][/p][p]The sabbatthaka seems to have been a gift of various things in groups of eight: eight elephants, eight horses, eight thousand pieces of money, etc.  (DhA.iii.3); but see Mil.Trs.ii.147, n.1, where it is spoken of as an office.[/p][p]Ekasātaka is given in the Anguttara Commentary (loc.  cit.) as a previous birth of the Elder Mahā Kassapa.

He is, however, stated as having lived in the time of Gotama Buddha, although the story related is, in most respects, identical with that given above, except that the king in the story of Culla-Ekasātaka is Pasenadi, king of Kosala.  No mention is made of the brahmin being created purohita.  Moreover, this brahmin received as gift only the sabbacatukka (groups of four) and not the sabatthaka.

(For an account of Upatissa see Cv.xli.5f).  Upatissa belonged to the Lambakanna clan, and in Sinhalese writing is called Lāmāni-upatissa (Cv.Trs.i.52, n.1).[/p][p][/p][p]5. Upatissa.-Son of Silākāla and brother of Dāthāpabhuti and Moggallāna II.  He was a good-looking young man and was his father's favourite.  He was killed by Dāthāpabhuti (Cv.xli.33ff).[/p][p][/p][p]6. Upatissa Thera.-Called Pāsānadīpavāsī Upatissa.  He appears to have written a Commentary on the Mahāvamsa, which the author of the Mahāvamsa Tīkā used for his own work, sometimes criticising its comments.  See, e.g., MT.47.[/p][p][/p][p]7. Upatissa.-Thera of Tambapapidīpa (Ceylon), perhaps to be identified with No.  6 above.  He and his colleague, Phussadeva, are often mentioned as being expert exponents of the Vinaya.  Upatissa had two pupils, Mahāpaduma and Mahāsumma, who became very famous as vinayadharā.  Mahāpaduma "read" through the Vinaya eighteen times with his teacher, and Mahāsumma nine times (Sp.i.263f).  Buddhaghosa evidently regarded with great respect the explanations of various Vinaya questions as given by Upatissa, for he often quotes him.  See, e.g., Sp.ii.456; iii.624, 714; iv.890.[/p][p][/p][p]8. Upatissa.-Sāriputta's father and chieftain of Nālaka or Upatissagāma (q.v.).  His proper name was Vanganta (q.v.), Upatissa being, evidently, his clan name (SnA.i.326).[/p][p][/p][p]9. Upatissa Thera.-Author of the Pāli Mahābodhi-vamsa.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Uparevata[/div][hr][p]1. Uparevata.-A sāmanera, son of Padumuttara Buddha.  It was the sight of this novice which made Rāhula, then born as the Nāga-king Sankha, wish to become a Buddha's son (SnA.i.340; MA.ii.722).  According to the Buddhavamsa (xi.21), however, Padumuttara's son was called Uttara.  Uparevata, though very young in years (tarunalalitadāraka), was possessed of great iddhi-powers and the Nāga-king was greatly impressed by him (AA.i.142f.  Here the nāga king is called Pathayindhara).[/p][p][/p][p]2. Uparevata.-Nephew of Sāriputta.  When Sāriputta went to Nālaka on his last visit, in order to die there, Uparevata saw him outside the village, seated under a banyan tree.  He was asked to announce Sāriputta's arrival to the latter's mother, and to make preparations for accommodating Sāriputta's five hundred followers (DA.ii.551; SA.iii.175).[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Uppalavannā [/div][hr][p]1. Uppalavannā Therī.-One of the two chief women disciples of the Buddha.  She was born in Sāvatthi as the daughter of a banker, and she received the name of Uppalavannā because her skin was the colour of the heart of the blue lotus.  When she was come of age, kings and commoners from the whole of India sent messengers to her father, asking for her hand.  He, not wishing to offend any of them, suggested that Uppalavannā should leave the world.  Because of her upanissaya, she very willingly agreed and was ordained a nun.  Soon it came to her turn to perform certain services in the uposatha-hall.  Lighting the lamp, she swept the room.  Taking the flame of the lamp as her visible object, she developed tejokasina and, attaining to jhāna, became an arahant possessed of the four special attainments (patisambhidā).  She became particularly versed in the mystic potency of transformation (iddhivikubbana).  When the Buddha arrived at the Gandamba-tree to perform the Twin Miracle, Uppalavannā offered to perform certain miracles herself, if the Buddha would give his consent, but this he refused (ThigA.190, 195).  Later, at Jetavana, in the assembly of the Sangha, he declared her to be the chief of the women possessed of iddhi-power (A.i.25).  The Therīgāthā (vv.234-5) contains several verses attributed to her.[/p][p]Three of them had been uttered in anguish by a mother who had been unwittingly living as her daughter's rival with the man who later became the monk Gangātīriya (q.v.).  Uppalavannā repeated them to help her to reflect on the harm and vileness of sensual desires.  Two others are utterances of joy on the distinctions she had won and another records a miracle she performed before the Buddha, with his consent.  The rest contain a conversation between Uppalavannā and Māra (a conversation, more or less identical with the foregoing, is recorded in S.i.131f), wherein she tells him that she has passed completely beyond his power.[/p][p]The books give several episodes connected with Uppalavannā.  Once a young man named Ananda, who was her cousin and had been in love with her during her lay-life, hid himself in her hut in Andhavana and, in spite of her protestations, deprived her of her chastity.  It is said that he was swallowed up by the fires of Avīcī.  From that time onwards, nuns were forbidden to live in Andhavana (DhA.ii.49f; the incident is referred to in Vin.iii.35).  It is said (E.g., DhA.iv.166f) that this incident gave rise to the question whether even arahants enjoyed the pleasures of love and wished to gratify their passions.  Why should they not? For they are not trees nor ant-hills, but living creatures with moist flesh.  The Buddha most emphatically declared that thoughts of lust never entered the hearts of the saints.  On another occasion, Uppalavannā came across, in Andhavana, some meat left behind, obviously for her, by some kind-hearted thief; having cooked the meat, she took it to the Buddha at Veluvana.  Finding him away on his alms-rounds, she left the meat with Udāyi, who was looking after the vihāra, to be given to the Buddha, but Udāyi insisted on Uppalavannā giving him her inner robe as a reward for his services (Vin.iii.208f).[/p][p]According to the Dhammapada Commentary (iii.211), the miracle which Uppalavannā volunteered to perform at the Gandamba-tree, was the assumption of the form of a cakkavatti, with a retinue extending for thirty-six leagues and the paying of homage to the Buddha, with all the cakkavatti's followers, in the presence of the multitude.[/p][p]Mention is made of a pupil of Uppalavannā, who followed the Buddha for seven years, learning the Vinaya (Vin.ii.261).[/p][p]The Buddha declares that Khemā and Uppalavannā are the measure of his women disciples, and that the believing nun, if she would aspire perfectly, should aspire to be like them (A.i.88; ii.164; S.ii.236).[/p][p]In Padumuttara's time Uppalavannā saw a woman disciple who was declared to be the best of those possessed of supernormal power, and wished for herself a similar rank in the dispensation of a future Buddha.  In the time of Kassapa, she was one of the seven daughters of Kikī, king of Benares, and having done many good deeds, was born in heaven.  Later, she was born in the world of men and had to work for her own living.  One day she gave to a Pacceka Buddha, who had just risen from samādhi, a meal of fried rice in his bowl and covered it with a beautiful lotus; the meal had been prepared for herself.  The lotus she afterwards took back but again replaced it, asking the Pacceka Buddha's forgiveness.  She expressed a wish that she should beget as many sons as there were grains of rice in her gift, and that lotuses should spring up under her feet as she walked.  In her next birth she was born in a lotus.  An ascetic adopted her as his daughter, but when she grew up, the king of Benares, hearing of her beauty, asked the ascetic for her hand and made her his chief queen, under the name of Padumavatī.  The king's other wives were jealous of her beauty, and when the king was away, quelling a rising of the border tribes, they concealed in caskets the five hundred sons, chief of whom was the prince Mahāpaduma (q.v.), that were born to Padumavatī, and told the king that Padumavatī was a non-human and had given birth to a log of wood.  Padumavatī was sent away in disgrace, but later, through the instrumentality of Sakka, the trick was exposed, and Padumavatī regained all her former power and glory.  (Her temporary downfall was due to her having withdrawn her gift of a lotus to the Pacceka Buddha.) Later, when Mahāpaduma and his brothers became Pacceka Buddhas, Padumavatī died of a broken heart and was born in a village outside Rājagaha.  There some of the Pacceka Buddhas who had been her sons discovered her, and they all came to a meal at her house.  At the conclusion of the meal she offered them blue lotuses, and expressed the wish that her complexion should be like the matrix of the blue lotus.  [/p][p]This account is a summary of the Therīgāthā Commentary, pp.182ff; AA.i.188ff; but see also DhA.ii.48f.[/p][p]The Apadāna account of the past lives of Uppakavanna differs from the above in several details (ii.551. But vv.1-15 quoted in the ThigA.  differ from those in the Apadāna, and agree with the ThigA.  account).  According to this account, in Padumuttara's time she was a Nāga maiden named Vimalā and was impressed by the iddhi-powers displayed by a nun, hence her wish for similar powers.  The Apadāna also mentions Uppalavannā's birth as the daughter of a banker of Benares, in the time of Vipassī.  She gave great alms to the Buddha and the monks and made offerings of lotuses.  She was the second daughter of Kikī and her name was Samannaguttā.  In her next birth she became the ravishing daughter of Tirītavaccha of Aritthapura.  In her last birth she became an arahant within a fortnight of her ordination.[/p][p]Uppalavannā's name occurs several times in the Jātakas.  In the Kharādiya Jātaka (J.i.160) she was a deer, the sister of the Bodhisatta; in the Tipallatthamiga Jātaka (J.i.164) she was the mother of Rāhula, then born as a stag.  She is identified with the old woman, the foster-mother of Ayyakālaka (J.i.196), with the queen Mudulakkhanā (J.i.306), the brahminee in the Sārambha (J.i.375), the courtesan in the Kurudhamma (J.ii.381), the brahmin's daughter (and sister of Rāhula) in the Dhonasākha (J.iii.168), Siridevī in the Sirikālakanni (J.iii.264), the goddess in the Bhisapuppha (J.iii.310), Manoja's sister in the Manoja (J.iii.324), the ascetic's daughter in the Kumbhakāra (J.iii.383), the deity in the Jāgarajā (J.iii.405), in the Sankha (J.iv.22), and in the Kiñchanda (J.v.11), the sister in the Bhisa (J.iv.314), Sutanā in the Rohantamiga (J.iv.423), the younger sister in the Jayaddisa (J.v.36), Kundalinī in the Tesakuna (J.v.125), Ummadantī in the Ummadantī (J.v.227), Hiridevatā in the Sudhābhojana (J.v.412), the goddess of the parasol in the Mūgapakkha (J.vi.29), the ocean spirit in the Mahājanaka (J.vi.68), the goddess in the Sāma (J.vi.95), Selā in the Khandahāla (J.vi.157), Accimukhī in the Bhūridatta (J.vi.219), Bherī in the Mahā-ummagga (J.vi.478) and Kanhajinā in the Vessantara (J.vi.593).[/p][p]It was Uppalavannā who ordained Anojā and her companions, by the express wish of the Buddha (AA.i.178).[/p][hr][p]2. Uppalavannā.-One of the two daughters of Kassapa I.  of Ceylon, the other being Bodhī.  The king built a vihāra and called it by his own name together with those of his daughters.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Upakkilesa Sutta[/div][hr][p]1. Upakkilesa Sutta.-Preached at Pācīnavamsadāya to Anuruddha, Nandiya and Kimbila.  It was at the time of the quarrel of the Kosambī monks; the Buddha, in search of quietness, goes to Bālakalonaka, preaches there to Bhagu and proceeds to Pācīnavamsadāya, where he tells his cousins how they should develop meditation, getting rid of all obstacles.  M.iii.152ff.  The verses of the sutta are also found in the Vinaya version (i.349ff).  Some of the verses are included in the Dhammapada (vv.328-30) and in the Khaggavisāna Butts of the Sutta Nipāta (vv.11, 12).[/p][p][/p][p]2. Upakkilesa Sutta.-Gold ore must be purified from all its dross before it can be used for making ornaments, etc.; similarly, the mind must be freed from its impurities - the five nīvaranas - before it can be used for acquiring the higher knowledge (A.iii.16-19).[/p][p][/p][p]3. Upakkilesa Sutta.-Four things prevent the sun and the moon from shining with their full brilliance - clouds, mist, smoke and dust and Rāhu.  Similarly four things diminish the holiness of ascetics and recluses - intoxicants, sex, money and wrong livelihood (A.ii.53f).[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Uttareyyadāyaka Thera[/div][p]An arahant.  In Padumuttara's time he was a learned brahmin of Hamsavatī.  One day, when going to bathe with his pupils, he saw the Buddha and gave him his upper garment (uttarīya).  The garment remained in the sky, forming a canopy over the Buddha and his monks.  As a result, for thirty thousand kappas, Uttareyyadāyaka was born in the deva-worlds, and fifty times he became king of the gods.  On thirty-six occasions he was king of men.  Everywhere he went a canopy of fine material appeared over him and he obtained all he wished for.  Ap.i.272-3.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Upatissagāma[/div][hr][p]1. Upatissagāma.-A brahmin village near Rājagaha.  It was the birthplace of Sāriputta (ThagA.ii.93; DhA.i.73).  Its real name was Nālaka (q.v.), but it was called Upatissagāma, evidently because its chieftains belonged to the Upatissa clan.  It is probable that Sāriputta's father, who was head of the village (gāmasāmi), was also called Upatissa.  See SnA.i.326.[/p][p][/p][p]2. Upatissagāma (sometimes called Upatissanagara).-The settlement founded by Vijaya's chaplain, Upatissa, on the banks of the Gambhīra-nadī, about seven miles to the north of Anurādhapura (Mhv.vii.44; Mhv.Trs.58, n.4; Dpv.ix.36; x.5).  It was the seat of government till Anurādhapura became the capital (See, e.g., Mhv.viii.4; x.48).  Soon after Mahinda's arrival in Ceylon many young men joined the Order, and among them there were five hundred from Upatissagāma (Mhv.xvii.60).[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Uposathakkhandha Sutta[/div][p]One of the discourses occurring in the Uposathakhandha.  It is quoted in the Atthasālinī as authority that might be used by any opponent to prove that an immoral act of speech also arises in the mind-door.  [/p][p][/p][p]The Commentary proceeds to explain how this argument could be refuted (DhsA.92f).[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Upasīva-mānava-pucchā[/div][p]The sixth sutta of the Parāyanavagga.  It contains the questions asked of the Buddha by Upasīva and the answers thereto (Sn.vv.1069-76).  One of Upasīva's questions was as to how the floods (ogha) may be crossed.  We are told that he was an ākiñcaññāyatanalābhī.  SnA.ii.593f; see also Culla-Niddesa, p.101.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Uparittha[/div][p]A Pacceka Buddha (M.iii.69; ApA.i.106).  In a previous life, when Anuruddha was born as Annabhāra, he offered alms to the Pacceka Buddha and made various wishes which were fulfilled in later births (DhA.i.113f).  Uparittha had spent seven days in meditation on Gandhamādana, and when he appeared before Annabhāra, the latter ran home to his wife, fetched the food which had been prepared for themselves and gave it to Uparittha.  Uparittha ate the meal seated on Annabhāra's garment, which was spread on the ground for him.  AA.i.105; Thag.910; ThagA.ii.66.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Udakadāyikā Therī[/div][p]An arahant.  In a previous birth she was a water-carrier and maintained her children on her wages.  Having nothing else to give, she regularly provided water in a bath for others.  As a result, she was born in heaven and was fifty times queen of the deva-king and twenty times queen of kings on earth.  She could produce rain at will, and her body knew neither heat nor dirt.  Ap.ii.521-2.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Uruvelakappa[/div][p]A township of the Mallas in the Malla country.  Once when the Buddha was staying there, Bhadragaka, the headman of the town, visited him, and the Buddha preached to him a sermon on the arising and the cessation of Ill (S.iv.327f).  It was perhaps on the same occasion that the Buddha was visited by the headman Rāsiya, and he seems to have talked to him on various topics connected with the doctrine (S.iv.330ff).  Record is also made of a sermon preached by the Buddha at Uruvelakappa and addressed to the monks regarding the importance of insight (ariyañāna) (S.iv.228f).[/p][p][/p][p]Once when the Buddha was staying at Uruvelakappa, he informed Ananda that he wished to spend the day alone in the Mahāvana, and he went there and sat down at the foot of a tree.  Meanwhile the householder Tapassu arrived and told Ananda that be could not understand how young men in the prime of life found any attraction in renouncing the world.  Ananda took Tapassu to the Buddha, who set his doubts at rest.  (A.iv.438ff)[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Uddaka-Rāmaputta[/div][p]One of the teachers under whom Gotama, after leaving the world and before he became the Buddha, received instruction (J.i.66, 81).  Uddaka taught him the doctrine which had been realised and proclaimed by his father Rāma, which was the attainment of the state of "neither-consciousness-nor-unconsciousness" (corresponding to the fourth Jhāna).  When Gotama had mastered this, Uddaka made him more than his own equal by setting him over the whole company of his disciples as their teacher.  But Gotama, finding this doctrine unsatisfactory, abandoned it (M.i.165ff., 240ff.; DhA.i.70-1).  [/p][p][/p][p]The Buddha evidently had a high regard for Uddaka-Rāmaputta, for after the Enlightenment, when looking for someone to whom the Dhamma might be preached, and who was capable of realising its import at once, his thoughts turned to Uddaka, but Uddaka was already dead (Vin.i.7).[/p][p][/p][p]In the Vassakāra Sutta of the Anguttara Nikāya (ii.180) it is mentioned that King Eleyya, together with his bodyguard, Yamaka, Moggalla and others, were followers of Rāmaputta and that they held him in great esteem.  [/p][p][/p][p]In the Samyutta Nikāya (iv.83f) the Buddha says that Uddaka claimed to be "versed in lore and to have conquered everything, digging out the root of Ill," though he had no justification for such a claim.[/p][p][/p][p]Again, in the Pāsādika Sutta (D.iii.126-7), the Buddha tells Cunda that when Uddaka said "seeing, he seeth not," he had in mind a man who saw the blade of a sharpened razor but not its edge - a low, pagan thing to speak about.[/p][p][/p][p]In the Sanskrit books Uddaka-Rāmaputta is called Udraka.

Three days in succession the Buddha came, and Udaya, feeling annoyed, said to the Buddha: "A pertinacious and greedy man is the Samana Gotama that he comes again and again." The Buddha pointed out to him how, again and again, the furrow has to be sown to ensure a continuous supply of food, how over and over again the dairy-folk draw milk, and how again and again birth and death come to the slow-witted.

Bu.xviii.21; J.i.40; BuA.189.[/p][hr][p][b]4. Udaya.[/b]-The Bodhisatta born as king of Benares.  In his previous birth he had been a servant of Suciparivāra (q.v.).  On fast days it was the custom in Suciparivāra's house for everyone, even down to the cowherds, to observe the uposatha, but this servant, being new to the place, was not aware of this.  He went to work early in the morning and returned late in the evening.  When he discovered that all the others were keeping the fast he refused to touch any food and, as a result, died the same night.  Just before death he saw the king of Benares passing in procession with great splendour, and felt a desire for royalty.  He was therefore born as the son of the king of Benares and was named Udaya.  In due course he became king, and one day, having seen Addhamāsaka (q.v.) and learnt his story, he gave him half his kingdom.  Later, when Addhamāsaka confessed to him the evil idea that had passed through his mind of killing the king in order to gain the whole kingdom, Udaya, realising the wickedness of desire, renounced the kingdom and became an ascetic in the Himālaya.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Uttaradesa[/div][p]A province of Ceylon, probably to the north of Anurādhapura.  It was often occupied by the Tamils, and its chiefs refused to acknowledge allegiance to the Sinhalese kings.  Its people had to be subdued from time to time by the Sinhalese kings, in order to establish the peace of the land and the security of the throne (See, e.g., Cv.xliv.71; xlvii.3, 54; xlviii.83-4, 95, 112).[/p][p]The district formed a convenient landing-place for invaders coming to Ceylon from India, where they might complete their preparations (E.g., Cv.i.14).

  <e>[div class="huge"]Udayabhadda[/div][p]The Bodhisatta, born as king of Benares.  He was so called ("Welcome") because he was born to his parents as a result of their prayers.  He had a step-sister, Udayabhaddā.  When his parents wished him to marry, he refused, but in the end, yielding to their entreaties, he made a woman's image in gold and desired them to find a wife who resembled it.  Udayabhaddā alone could rival the image, so she was wedded to Udayabhadda.  They lived together in chastity and, in due course, when Udayabhadda died, the princess became queen.  The king was born as Sakka, and honouring a promise he had made to the princess to return and announce to her the place of his birth, he visited her as soon as he remembered her, and, before revealing himself, tested her in various ways.  Being satisfied with her conduct, he instructed her and went away.  The princess, renouncing the kingdom, became a recluse.  Later she was born in Tāvatimsa as the Bodhisatta's handmaiden.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Upasena [/div][hr][p]1. Upasena Thera.-Maternal uncle of Vijitasena Thera and brother of Sena.  He was an elephant-trainer, and having heard the Buddha preach, he entered the Order and, in due course, became an arahant.  He ordained Vijitasena (ThagA.i.424).  According to the Mahāvastu (iii.60ff), Sāriputta was converted to Buddhism not by Assaji, as recorded in the Pitakas, but by an Elder named Upasena, who is, perhaps, to be identified with the Upasena.  The Mahāvastu (iii.431f) also mentions an Upasena who was nephew to the Tebhātika Jatilas.  When the Tebhātikas accepted the Buddha as their teacher, they cast the garments, etc., which they had used as ascetics, into the Nerañjarā, on the banks of which was Upasena's hermitage.  When Upasena saw the robes, etc., he knew that something must have happened to his uncles.  He went at once to see them and, having heard the good tidings of their new-found bliss became a monk himself.  It is not stated whether this Upasena is identical with the Elder of the same name mentioned above as the teacher of Sāriputta.[/p][p][/p][hr][p]2. Upasena Vangantaputta.-He was born in.  Nālaka as the son of Rūpasārī, the brahminee, his father being Vanganta.  He was the younger brother of Sāriputta (UdA.266; DhA.ii.188).  When he came of age, he learnt the three Vedas, and, having heard the Buddha preach, entered the Order.  When his ordination was but one year old, he ordained another bhikkhu, to increase the number of holy ones, and went with him to wait upon the Buddha.  The Buddha roundly rebuked him for this hasty procedure (Vin.i.59; Sp.i.194; J.ii.449), and Upasena, wishing to earn the Master's praise on account of the very cause of this rebuke, practised insight and became an arahant.  Thereafter he adopted various dhutangas and persuaded others to do likewise.  In a short time he had a large retinue, each member of which was charming in his way, and the Buddha declared Upasena to be the best of those who were altogether charming (samantapāsādikānam) (A.i.24).  Buddhaghosa says that Upasena was famed as a very clever preacher (pathavighutthadhammakathika), and many joined him because of his eloquence.  AA.i.152; also Mil.360, where more details are given of how Upasena admitted monks into the Order and of the conditions imposed on them; for a slightly different version see Vin.iii.230ff; it is said there that after Upasena's visit, the Buddha allowed monks who practised dhutangas, to visit him even during his periods of retreat.  See also Sp.iii.685f.[/p][p][/p][p]He visited the Buddha when the Buddha had enjoined on himself a period of solitude for a fortnight; the monks had agreed that anyone who went to see the Buddha would be guilty of a pācittiya offence, but the Buddha, desiring to talk to him, asked one of Upasena's followers if he liked rag-robes.  "No, Sir, but I wear them out of regard for my teacher," was the reply.[/p][p]In the Theragāthā are found several verses ascribed to Upasena as having been spoken by him in answer to a question by his saddhivihdrika, regarding what was to be done during the dissensions of the Kosambī monks (vv.  577-86; the first verse is quoted in the Milinda 371 and also the fifth 395).  The Milinda-pañha (pp.393, 394) contains several other verses attributed to Upasena similar in their trend of ideas and admonitions.  The Udāna states (p.45f; UdA.266ff) that once when he was taking his siesta he reviewed the happiness he enjoyed and the glories of the life he led under the guidance of the Buddha.  The Buddha, noticing this, proclaimed his approval.[/p][p]One day, while Upasena was sitting after his meal in the shadow of the Sappasondika-pabbhāra, fanned by the gentle breeze, mending his outer robe, two young snakes were sporting in the tendrils overhanging the cave.  One fell on his shoulder and bit him, and the venom spread rapidly throughout his body; he called to Sāriputta and other monks who were near, and requested that he might be taken outside on a couch, there to die.  This was done, and his body "was scattered there and then like a handful of chaff." (S.iv.40f; SA.iii.10).[/p][p]Upasena had been, in Padumuttara's day, a householder of Hamsavatī.  One day he heard the Buddha declare one of his monks to be the best of those who were altogether charming, and wished for a similar declaration regarding himself by some future Buddha.  Towards this end he did many deeds of piety (ThagA.i.525).  The Apadāna mentions that he gave a meal to Padumuttara and eight monks, and at the meal placed over the Buddha's head a parasol made of kanikdra-flowers.  As a result, he was thirty times king of the devas and twenty-one times cakkavatti.  (Ap.i.62).  The verses quoted from the Apadāna in the ThagA.  are slightly different.[/p][p]Upasena is given, together with Yasa Kākandakaputta, as an example of one who observed the Vinaya precepts thoroughly, without imposing any new rules or agreements.

Later, Campeyya took him to the Nāga-world and shewed him every honour.  Uggasena's subjects were allowed to bring back from the Nāga-world whatever they desired (J.v.458ff; Mtu.ii.177ff).[/p][p]The story is told in the Campeyya Jātaka (q.v.).

He fell in love with a very skilful acrobat, married her and followed her about with her troupe.  When he discovered that she despised him for his lack of skill as an acrobat, he learnt the art and became a clever tumbler.  The Buddha knew that Uggasena was ready for conversion and entering Rājagaha while Uggasena was displaying his skill before a large crowd of people, withdrew their attention from his skilful feats.  Seeing Uggasena's disappointment, the Buddha sent Moggallāna to ask him to continue his performance, and while Uggasena was displaying his skill by various tricks, the Buddha preached to him, and Uggasena became an arahant, even as he stood poised on the tip of a pole, and later became a monk.  His wife also left the world soon after and attained arahantship.[/p][p]In the time of Kassapa Buddha they were husband and wife.  On their way to the shrine of the Buddha where they worked as labourers, they saw an Elder and gave him part of the food they had with them and expressed the desire that they should, one day, like him, realise the Truth.  The Elder, looking into the future, saw that their wish would be fulfilled and smiled.  The wife, seeing him smile, said to her husband that the Elder must be an actor, and the husband agreed.  Because of this remark they became actors in this life, but through their pious gift they attained arahantship.  DhA.iv.59-65; also ibid., 159.[/p][hr][p]3.

Among householders he was declared by the Buddha to be the best of those who waited on the Order (sanghupatthākānam) (A.i.26).  On his father's death he was appointed to the post of setthi.  Once when the Buddha went to Hatthigāma during a tour and was staying in the Nāgavanuyyāna there, Ugga came to the pleasance, with dancers, at the conclusion of a drinking-feast of seven days' duration.  At the sight of the Buddha he was seized with great shame and his intoxication vanished.  The Buddha preached to him and he became an anāgāmī.  Thereupon he dismissed his dancers and devoted himself to looking after members of the Sangha.  Devas visited him at night and told him of the attainments of various monks, suggesting that he should choose only the eminent ones as the recipients of his gifts.  But what he gave, he gave to all with equal delight (AA.i.214-5).[/p][p]The Buddha once stated that Ugga was possessed of eight special and wonderful qualities.  One of the monks, hearing the Buddha's statement, went to Ugga and asked him what these qualities were.  Ugga replied that he was not aware of what the Buddha had in mind and proceeded to explain eight wonderful things that had happened to him, viz.: [/p][ul][li](1) As soon as he saw the Buddha, his state of drunkenness vanished and he made obeisance to the Buddha, who talked to him on various topics, such as dāna, sīla, etc.  [/li][li](2) When the Buddha saw that Ugga's mind was ready, he preached to him the Four Truths, which he understood and realised.  [/li][li](3) He had had four young and beautiful wives; when he took the vow of celibacy, he made ample provision for them; for one of them he obtained the husband of her choice, because she so desired, and this he did with no tinge of jealousy.  [/li][li](4) All his immense wealth he shared with men of good and lovely conduct.  [/li][li](5) On whatever monk he waited, he did it with whole-heartedness; to the monk's preaching he listened earnestly; if the monk did not preach, Ugga himself taught him the doctrine.  [/li][li](6) Devas told him of the different attainments of various monks, but he gave to all alike, without distinction.  [/li][li](7) He felt no pride that he should hold converse with devas.  [/li][li](8) He did not worry about death because the Buddha had assured him that he would never more return to this world.[/li][/ul][p]The monk reports this conversation to the Buddha and the Buddha tells him that these were the very qualities he had in mind when praising Ugga (A.iv.212-6).[/p][p]The Samyutta Nikāya (Vajjī Sutta[b], [/b] S.iv.109f) records a visit paid to the Buddha by Ugga, at Hatthigāmaka.  He asked the Buddha why it was that some beings attained full freedom in this very life, while others did not.  Because of grasping, says the Buddha.[/p][p]Ugga had been a householder in the time of Padumuttara Buddha.  He once heard the Buddha preach and declare, at the end of his sermon, one of his lay disciples to be the best of those who waited on the Order.  He wished for himself a similar attainment and did many good deeds towards that end (AA.i.214).  v.l.  Uggata.[/p][hr][p][b]5. Ugga.[/b]-A householder of Vesāli, declared by the Buddha to be the best of those who gave agreeable gifts (manāpadāyakānam).  (A.i.26; in SA.iii.26 he is wrongly described as aggo panītadāyakānam - the title of Mahānāma).[/p][p]His original name is not known.  He came to be called Ugga-setthi, because he was tall in body, lofty in morals and of striking personality.  The very first time he saw the Buddha, he became a sotāpanna and later an anāgāmī.  When he was old, the thought came to him one day, while he was alone, "I will give to the Buddha whatever I consider most attractive to myself and I have heard from him that such a giver obtains his wishes.  I wish the Buddha would come to my house now." The Buddha, reading his thoughts, appeared before his door with a following of monks.  He received them with great respect and, having given them a meal, announced to the Buddha his intention of providing him and the monks with whatever they found agreeable (AA.i.213-4).[/p][p]While staying at the Kūtāgārasālā in Vesāli, the Buddha once declared to the monks that Ugga was possessed of eight marvellous qualities.  The rest of the story is very similar to that of Ugga of Hatthigāmaka, given above.  This Ugga states as the first wonderful thing which happened to him, the faith he found in the Buddha at their very first meeting; three and four are the same; the fifth is that whatever monk he waits on, he does it whole-heartedly; the sixth, that if the monk preaches he would listen with attention, if the monk does not preach, Ugga would teach to him the doctrine; the seventh is the same; the eighth that he has got rid of all the orambhāgiya-samyojanas mentioned by the Buddha.  The conversation is reported to the Buddha who agrees that Ugga does possess the qualities mentioned (A.iv.208-12).[/p][p]The Samyutta Nikāya (S.iv.109f) repeats under Ugga of Vesāli the same discussion with the Buddha as was given in connection with Ugga of Hatthigāma, regarding the reason why some beings do not attain complete freedom in this very life.  This is perhaps due to uncertainty on the part of the compilers as to which Ugga took part in the original discussion.[/p][p]A sutta in the Anguttara Nikāya (A.iii.49-51) gives a list of things of which Ugga himself was fond.  We are told that he offered these things to the Buddha.  The list includes rice-cakes made in the shape of Sāla-blossoms, the flesh of sucking pig and Kāsi robes.  These and other things were given not only to the Buddha, but, according to the Commentary (AA.ii.602), also to five hundred monks.  The Sutta goes on to say that Ugga died soon after and was born among the Manomayadevā.  He visited the Buddha from the deva-world and stated that he had achieved his goal (of reaching arahantship).[/p][p]He is included in a list of householders who possessed six special qualities: unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, Ariyan conduct, insight and liberation (A.iv.451).[/p][p]His desire to become chief of those who give agreeable things was first conceived in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, when he was a householder in Hamsavatī; he heard the Buddha describe one of his disciples as being a giver of such gifts (AA.i.213).[/p][hr][p][b]6. Ugga.[/b]-A thera.  He was the son of a banker in Ugga, in the Kosala country.  When the Buddha was staying in the Bhaddārāma there, Ugga heard him preach and entered the Order.  Soon afterwards he became an arahant (Thag.v.80; ThagA.i.174-5).[/p][p]He had been a householder in the time of Sikhī Buddha and offered him a ketaka-flower.

Probably the Uggārāma, mentioned in the story of Anganika Bhāradvāja (ThagA.i.339; Brethren, 157, n.4), was also in Ugga, in which case it was near the village of Kundiya of the Kuru country.[/p]</e>

A different version occurs elsewhere (S.v.232), where the thought which arose in the Buddha's mind referred to the five controlling faculties (saddhindriya, etc.), and Brahmā tells the Buddha that in the time of Kassapa he had been a monk named Sahaka and that then he had practised these five faculties.[/p][p]The name Uruvela is explained as meaning a great sandbank (mahā velā, mahanto vālikarāsi).  A story is told which furnishes an alternative explanation: Before the Buddha's appearance in the world, ten thousand ascetics lived in this locality, and they decided among themselves that if any evil thought arose in the mind of any one of them, he should carry a basket of sand to a certain spot.  The sand so collected eventually formed a great bank (AA.ii.476; UdA.26; MA.i.376; MT.84).  In the Divyāvadāna (p.202), the place is called Uruvilvā.  The Mahāvastu (ii.207) mentions four villages as being in Uruvelā: Praskandaka, Balākalpa, Ujjangala and Jangala.[/p][hr][p][b]2. Uruvelā.[/b]-A township in Ceylon, founded by one of the ministers of Vijaya (Dpv.ix.35; Mhv.vii.45).  According to a different tradition (Mhv.ix.9; perhaps this refers to another settlement), it was founded by a brother of Bhaddakacānā, called Uruvela.  Uruvelā was evidently a port as well, because we are told that when Dutthagāmanī decided to build the Mahā-Thūpa, six wagonloads of pearls as large as myrobalan fruit, mixed with coral, appeared on dry land at the Uruvela-pattana (Mhv.xxviii.36).  Near Uruvelā was the Vallī-vihāra, built by Subha (Mhv.xxxv.58).[/p][p]Geiger thinks (Mhv.Trs.189, n.2) that Uruvelā was near the mouth of the modern Kalā Oya, five yojanas - i.e.  about forty miles - to the west of Anurādhapura.[/p][hr][p][b]3. Uruvelā.[/b]-A village to which Queen Sugalā (q.v.) fled, taking the sacred relies, the Alms Bowl and the Tooth Relic (Cv.lxxiv.88).  It is identified with Etimole about five or six miles south-east of Monorāgala (Cv.Trs.ii.29, n.4).  It is perhaps to be identified with Uruvelamandapa.[/p]</e>
