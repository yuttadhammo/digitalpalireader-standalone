  <e>[div class="huge"]Vessantara Jātaka (No.  547)[/div][p]Vessantara (the Bodhisatta) was the son of Sañjaya, king of Sivi, and queen Phusatī, and was so called because his mother started in labour as she passed through the vessa street in the city of Jetuttara, and he was born in a house in the same street.  He spoke as soon as he was born (Cf.  BuA.228).  On the same day was also born a white elephant named Paccaya.  At the age of eight, Vessantara wished to make a great gift and the earth trembled.  He married Maddī at the age of sixteen, and their children were Jāli and Kanhajinā.[/p][p]At that time there was a great drought in Kālinga, and eight brahmins came from there to Vessantara to beg his white elephant, which had the power of making rain to fall.  He granted their request, and gave the elephant together with its priceless trappings (J.vi.488f.  gives the details of these).  The citizens of Jetuttara were greatly upset that their elephant should have been given away, and demanded of Sañjaya that Vessantara should be banished to Vankagiri.  The will of the people prevailed, and Vessantara was asked to take the road along which those travel who have offended.  He agreed to go, but before setting out, obtained the king's leave to hold an almsgiving called the "Gift of the Seven Hundreds" (Sattasataka), in which he gave away seven hundred of each kind of thing.  People came from all over Jambudīpa to accept his gifts, and the almsgiving lasted for a whole day.[/p][p]When Vessantara took leave of his parents and prepared for his journey, Maddī insisted on accompanying him with her two children.  They were conveyed in a gorgeous carriage drawn by four horses, but, outside the city, Vessantara met four brahmins who begged his horses.  Four devas then drew the chariot, but another brahmin soon appeared and obtained the chariot.  Thenceforward they travelled on foot, through Suvannagiritāla, across the river Kantimārā, to beyond Mount Arañjaragiri and Dunnivittha, to his uncle's city, in the kingdom of Ceta.  The devas shortened the way for them, and the trees lowered their fruit that they might eat.  Sixty thousand khattiyas came out to welcome Vessantara and offered him their kingdom, which, however, he refused.  He would not even enter the city, but remained outside the gates, and, when he left early the next morning, the people of Ceta, led by Cetaputta, went with him for fifteen leagues, till they came to the entrance to the forest.  Vessantara and his family then proceeded to Gandhamādana, northwards, by the foot of Mount Vipula to the river Ketumatī, where a forester entertained them and gave them to eat.  Thence they crossed the river to beyond Nālika, along the bank of Lake Mucalinda, to its north eastern corner, then along a narrow footpath into the dense forest, to Vankagiri.  There Vissakamma had already built two hermitages, by order of Sakka, one for Vessantara and one for Maddī and the children, and there they took up their residence.  By Vessantara's power, the wild animals to a distance of three leagues became gentle.  Maddī rose daily at dawn, and, having fetched water to wash, went into the forest for yams and fruit.  In the evening she returned, washed the children, and the family sat down to eat.  Thus passed four months.[/p][p]Then from Dunnivittha there came to the hermitage an old brahmin, called Jūjaka, who had been sent by his young wife, Amittatāpanā, to find slaves for her, because when she went to the well for water the other women had laughed at her, calling her "old man's darling." She told Jūjaka that he could easily get Vessantara's children as slaves, and so he came to Vankagiri.  Asking the way of various people, including the hermit Accuta, Jūjaka arrived at Vankagiri late in the evening and spent the night on the hilltop.  That night Maddī had a dream, and, being terrified, she sought Vessantara.  He knew what the dream presaged, but consoled her and sent her away the next day in search of food.  During her absence, Jūjaka came and made his request.  He would not await the return of Maddī, and Vessantara willingly gave him the two children.  But they ran away and hid in a pond till told by their father to go with Jūjaka.  When Vessantara poured water on Jūjaka's hand as a symbol of his gift, the earth trembled with joy.  Once more the children escaped and ran back to their father, but he strengthened his resolve with tears in his eyes.  Jūjaka led the children away, beating them along the road till their blood flowed.[/p][p]It was late in the evening when Maddī returned because devas, assuming the form of beasts of prey, delayed her coming, lest she should stand in the way of Vessantara's gift.  In answer to her questions, Vessantara spoke no word, and she spent the night searching for the children.  In the morning she returned to the hermitage and fell down fainting.  Vessantara restored her to consciousness and told her of what had happened, explaining why he had not told her earlier.  When she had heard his story she expressed her joy, affirming that he had made a noble gift for the sake of omniscience.[/p][p]And then, lest some vile creature should come and ask for Maddī, Sakka, assuming the form of a brahmin, appeared and asked for her Vessantara looked at Maddī, and she expressed her consent.  So he gave Maddī to the brahmin, and the earth trembled.  Sakka revealed his identity, gave Maddī back to Vessantara, and allowed him eight boons.  Vessantara asked that [/p][ul][li](1) he be recalled to his father's city, [/li][li](2) he should condemn no man to death, [/li][li](3) he should be a helpmate to all alike [/li][li](4) he should not be guilty of adultery, [/li][li](5) his son should have long life: [/li][li](6) he should have celestial food, [/li][li](7) his means of giving should never fail, [/li][li](8) after death he should be reborn in heaven.[/li][/ul][p]In the meantime, Jūjaka had travelled sixty leagues with the children, whom the devas cared for and protected.  Guided by the devas, they arrived in fifteen days at Jetuttara, though Jūjaka had intended to go to Kālinga.  Sañjaya bought the children from Jūjaka, paying a high price, including the gift of a seven storeyed palace.  But Jūjaka died of over eating, and as no relation of his could be traced, his possessions came back to the king.  Sañjaya ordered his army to be prepared and a road to be built from Jetuttara to Vankagiri, eight usabhas wide.  Seven days later, led by Jāli, Sañjaya and Phusatī started for Vankagiri.[/p][p]In the army was the white elephant, who had been returned because the people of Kālinga could not maintain him.  There was great rejoicing at the reunion of the family, and the six royal personages fell in a swoon till they were revived by rain sent by Sakka, the rain only wetting those who so wished it.  Vessantara was crowned king of Sivi, with Maddī as his consort.  After a month's merry making in the forest, they returned to Jetuttara.  On the day Vessantara entered the city he set free every captive, including even cats.  In the evening, as he lay wondering how he would be able to satisfy his suitors the next day, Sakka's throne was heated, and he sent down a shower of the seven kinds of precious things, till the palace grounds were filled waist high.  Vessantara was thus able to practise his generosity to the end of his days.  After death he was born in Tusita (J.i.47; DhA.i.69).[/p][p]The story was related on the occasion of the Buddha's first visit to Kapilavatthu.  The Buddha's kinsmen escorted him to the Nigrodhārāma, but sat round him without doing any obeisance, because of their great pride.  The Buddha then performed the Twin Miracle, and the Sākyans, led by [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suddhodana,Suddhodana')"]Suddhodana[/a], worshipped him.  There was then a shower of rain, refreshing all and falling only on those who so wished.  When the people expressed their wonder, the Buddha related this story, showing that in the past, too, rain had fallen on his kinsfolk to revive them.  (According to BuA.245, the Jātaka was related at the end of the recital of the Buddhavamsa).[/p][ul][li]Devadatta is identified with Jūjaka, [/li][li]Cincā with Amittatāpanā, [/li][li]Channa with Cetaputta, [/li][li]Sāriputta with Accuta, [/li][li]Anuruddha with Sakka, [/li][li]Sañjaya with Suddhodana, [/li][li]Mahāmāyā with Phusatī, [/li][li]Rāhulamātā with Maddī, [/li][li]Rāhula with Jāli, and [/li][li]Uppalavanna with Kanhajinā.

Though the gifts were great, Velāma could find no holy persons as recipients.

Near the monastery was a forest, where Vattagāmanī, in his flight, hid the alms bowl of the Buddha.  There he also met the Elder Kupikkala Mahātissa (Mhv.xxxiii.48f).  The alms bowl was discovered and taken by a Damila to India, but was later recovered (Mhv.xxxiii.55).  To the south of Vessagiri was the Pabbata vihāra, and, near it, the village of Silāsobbhakandaka.  MT.616.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Veluka Jātaka (No.  43)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta was once at the head of five hundred hermits, one of whom had a pet viper which was called Veluka, because it was kept in a bamboo.  The Bodhisatta warned the ascetic against the snake, but his warning was unheeded.  The hermit thus came to be called Velukapitā.  One day the hermits went into the forest and were away for a few days, and when Velukapitā touched the viper on his return, the animal, hungry and angry, bit him, and he fell down dead.  The story was told in reference to a headstrong monk who is identified with Velukapitā.  J.i.245f.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Vesāli[/div][p]A city, capital of the Licchavis.  The Buddha first visited it in the fifth year after the Enlightenment, and spent the vassa there (BuA., p.  3).  The Commentaries give detailed descriptions of the circumstances of this visit.  KhpA.160ff.= SNA.i.278; DhA.iii.436ff.; cp.  Mtu.i.253ff[/p][p]Vesāli was inhabited by seven thousand and seven rājās, each of whom had large retinues, many palaces and pleasure parks.  There came a shortage in the food supply owing to drought, and people died in large numbers.  The smell of decaying bodies attracted evil spirits, and many inhabitants were attacked by intestinal disease.  The people complained to the ruling prince, and he convoked a general assembly, where it was decided, after much discussion, to invite the Buddha to their city.  As the Buddha was then at Veluvana in Rājagaha, the Licchavi Mahāli, friend of Bimbisāra and son of the chaplain of Vesāli, was sent to Bimbisāra with a request that he should persuade the Buddha to go to Vesāli.  Bimbisāra referred him to the Buddha himself, who, after listening to Mahāli's story, agreed to go.  The Buddha started on the journey with five hundred monks.  Bimbisāra decorated the route from Rājagaha to the Ganges, a distance of five leagues, and provided all comforts on the way.  He accompanied the Buddha, and the Ganges was reached in five days.  Boats, decked with great splendour, were ready for the Buddha and his monks, and we are told that Bimbisāra followed the Buddha into the water up to his neck.  The Buddha was received on the opposite bank by the Licchavis, with even greater honour than Bimbisāra had shown him.  As soon as the Buddha set foot in the Vajjian territory, there was a thunderstorm and rain fell in torrents.  The distance from the Ganges to Vesāli was three leagues; as the Buddha approached Vesāli, Sakka came to greet him, and, at the sight of the devas, all the evil spirits fled in fear.  In the evening the Buddha taught Ananda the Ratana Sutta, and ordered that it should be recited within the three walls of the city, the round of the city being made with the Licchavi princes.  This Ananda did during the three watches of the night, and all the pestilences of the citizens disappeared.  The Buddha himself recited the Ratana Sutta to the assembled people, and eighty four thousand beings were converted.  After repeating this for seven consecutive days, the Buddha left Vesāli.  (According to the DhA.  account the Buddha stayed only seven days in Vesāli; KhA.  says two weeks).  The Licchavis accompanied him to the Ganges with redoubled honours, and, in the river itself, Devas and Nāgas vied with each other in paying him honour.  On the farther bank, Bimbisāra awaited his arrival and conducted him back to Rājagaha.  On his return there, the Buddha recited the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sankha,Sankha Jātaka')"]Sankha Jātaka[/a].  (See 2.)[/p][p]It was probably during this visit of the Buddha to Vesāli that Suddhodana died.  (See ThigA., p.  141; AA.i.186).  [/p][p]It was during this visit of the Buddha to Kapilavatthu (tadā) that Mahā Pajāpatī Gotamī first asked his permission to join the Order, but her request was refused (AA.i.186).[/p][p]According to one account, the Buddha went through the air to visit his dying father and to preach to him, thereby enabling him to attain arahantship before his death.  It is not possible to know how many visits were paid by the Buddha to Vesāli, but the books would lead us to infer that they were several.  Various Vinaya rules are mentioned as having been laid down at Vesāli.  See, e.g., Vin.i.238, 287f; ii.118, 119 27. The visit mentioned in the last context seems to have been a long one; it was on this occasion that the Buddha ordered the monks to turn their bowls upon the Licchavi Vaddha (q.v.).  For other Vinaya rules laid down at Vesāli, see also Vin.ii.159f.; iii.  and iv.  passim.[/p][p]It was during a stay in Vesāli, whither he had gone from Kapilavatthu, that  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapajapati_gotami,Mahā Pajāpatī Gotamī')"]Mahā Pajāpatī Gotamī[/a] followed the Buddha with five hundred other Sākyan women, and, with the help of Ananda's intervention, obtained permission for women to enter the Order under certain conditions.  Vin.ii.253ff.; see [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapajapati_gotami,Mahā Pajāpatī Gotamī')"]Mahā Pajāpatī Gotamī[/a].[/p][p]The books describe (E.g., D.ii.95ff) at some length the Buddha's last visit to Vesāli on his way to Kusinārā.  On the last day of this visit, after his meal, he went with Ananda to Cāpāla cetiya for his siesta, and, in the course of their conversation, he spoke to Ananda of the beauties of Vesāli: of the Udena cetiya, the Gotamaka cetiya, the Sattambaka cetiya, the Bahuputta cetiya, and the Sārandada cetiya.  Cf.  Mtu.i.300, where a Kapinayha-cetiya is also mentioned.  All these were once shrines dedicated to various local deities, but after the Buddha's visit to Vesāli, they were converted into places of Buddhist worship.  Other monasteries are also mentioned, in or near Vesāli e.g., Pātikārāma, Vālikārāma.[/p][p]The Buddha generally stayed at the Kūtāgārasālā (q.v.) during his visits to Vesāli, but it appears that he sometimes lived at these different shrines (See D.ii.118).  During his last visit to the Cāpāla cetiya he decided to die within three months, and informed Māra and, later, Ananda, of his decision.  The next day he left Vesāli for Bhandagāma, after taking one last look at the city, "turning his whole body round, like an elephant" (nāgāpalokitam apaloketvā) (D.ii.122).  The rainy season which preceded this, the Buddha spent at Beluvagāma, a suburb of Vesāli, while the monks stayed in and around Vesāli.  On the day before he entered into the vassa, Ambapāli invited the Buddha and the monks to a meal, at the conclusion of which she gave her Ambavana for the use of the Order (D.ii.98; but see Dial.ii.102, n.1).[/p][p]Vesāli was a stronghold of the Niganthas, and it is said that of the forty two rainy seasons of the latter part of Mahāvīra's ascetic life, he passed twelve at Vesāli.  Jacobi: Jaina Sutras (S.B.E.) Kalpa Sūtra, sect.  122; Vesāli was also the residence of Kandaramasuka and Pātikaputta (q.v.).  Among eminent followers of the Buddha who lived in Vesāli, special mention is made of Ugga (chief of those who gave pleasant gifts), Pingiyāni, Kāranapāli, Sīha, Vāsettha (A.iv.258), and the various Licchavis (see Licchavi.)[/p][p]The Buddha's presence in Vesāli was a source of discomfort to the Niganthas, and we find mention (See, e.g., Sīha) of various devices resorted to by them to prevent their followers from coming under the influence of the Buddha.[/p][p]At the time of the Buddha, Vesāli was a very large city, rich and prosperous, crowded with people and with abundant food.  There were seven thousand seven hundred and seven pleasure grounds and an equal number of lotus ponds.  Its courtesan, Ambapālī, was famous for her beauty, and helped in large measure in making the city prosperous (Vin.i.268).  The city had three walls, each one gāvuta away from the other, and at three places in the walls were gates with watch towers.  [/p][p]J.i.604; cf.i.389. Perhaps these three walls separated the three districts of Vaisālī mentioned in the Tibetan Dulva (Rockhill, p.62); Hoernle (Uvāsagadasāo Translation ii., p.4, n.8) identifies these three districts with the city proper, Kundapura and Vāniyagāma, respectively mentioned in the Jaina books.  Buddhaghosa says (e.g., Sp.ii.393) that Vesāli was so called because it was extensive (visālībhūtatā Vesāli ti uccati); cf.  UdA.184 (tikkhattum visālabhūtattā); and MA.i.259.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Vissakamma, Vissukamma[/div][p]A deva, inhabitant of Tāvatimsa.  He is the chief architect, designer and decorator among the devas, and Sakka asks for his services whenever necessary.  Thus he was ordered to build the palace called Dhamma for Mahāsudassana (D.ii.180) and another for Mahāpanāda (J.iv.323; DA.iii.856).  [/p][p]He also built the hermitages for the Bodhisatta in various births - e.g., as [/p][ul][li]Sumedha (J.i.7)[/li][li]Kuddālapandita (J.i.314)[/li][li]Hatthipāla (J.iv.489)[/li][li]Ayoghara (J.iv.499)[/li][li]Jotipāla (J.v.132)[/li][li]Sutasoma (J.v.190)[/li][li]Temiya (J.vi.21, 29) [/li][li]Vessantara (J.vi.519f)[/li][/ul][p]Vissakamma also built the hermitage for Dukūlaka and Pārikā (J.vi.72).[/p][p]On the day that the Buddha renounced the world, Sakka sent Vissakamma in the guise of a shampooer to bathe him and clothe him in his royal ornaments (J.i.60; DhA.i.70; BuA.232; he also constructed ponds in which the prince might bathe, AA.i.379); he also sent him to adorn Temiya on the day he left the kingdom (J.vi.12).  [/p][p]Vissakamma erected the jewelled pavilion, twelve leagues in compass, under the Gandamba, where the Buddha performed the Twin Miracle and built the three stairways of jewels, silver and gold, used by the Buddha in his descent from Tāvatimsa to Sankassa (J.iv.265f).  He built, the pavilions in which the Buddha and five hundred arahants travelled to Uggapura, at the invitation of Culla Subhaddā.  (DhA.iii.470; and again for the journey to Sunāpuranta, MA.ii.1017).  [/p][p]When Ajātasattu deposited his share of the Buddha's relics in a thūpa, Sakka ordered Vissakamma to construct around the thūpa a vālasanghātayanta (revolving wheel?) to prevent anyone from approaching the relics.  Later, when Dhammāsoka (Piyadassī) wished to obtain these relics for his vihāra, Vissakamma appeared before him in the guise of a village youth and, by shooting an arrow at the controlling screw of the machine, stopped its revolutions (DA.ii.613, 614).  [/p][p]He constructed the jewelled pavilion in which Sonuttara placed the relies he brought from the Nāga world till the time came for them to be deposited in the Mahā Thūpa, (Mhv.xxxi.76) and on the day of their enshrinement, Vissakamma, acting on Sakka's orders, decorated the whole of Ceylon (Mhv.xxxi.34).  He also provided the bricks used in the construction of the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxviii.8).  Sometimes he would enter into a workman's body and inspire him with ideas - e.g., in designing the form of the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxx.11).  He was also responsible for the construction of the golden vase in which the branch of the Bodhi tree was conveyed to Ceylon (Mhv.xviii.24).[/p][p]As in the case of Mātalī and Sakka, Vissakamma is evidently the name of an office and not a personal name.  Thus, in the Suruci Jātaka (J.iv.  325), Vissakamma is mentioned as a previous birth of Ananda, while, according to the Dhammapada Commentary, the architect who helped Magha and his companions in their good works, was reborn as Vissakamma.  DhA.i.272. The story given regarding Vissakamma in SNA.i.233, evidently refers to the Mahākanha Jātaka.

Visākhā[/h4][p]The chief among the female lay disciples of the Buddha and declared by him to be foremost among those who ministered to the Order (dāyikānam aggā) (A.i.26; she is considered the ideal lay woman - e.g., A.iv.348).  Her father was Dhanañjaya, son of Mendaka, and her mother Sumanā.  She was born in the city of Bhaddiya in Anga.  When she was seven years old, the Buddha visited Bhaddiya with a large company of monks, out of compassion for the brahmin Sela and others.  Mendaka gave Visākhā five hundred companions, five hundred slaves, and five hundred chariots, that she might visit the Buddha.  She stopped the chariots some distance away and approached the Buddha on foot.  He preached to her and she became a sotāpanna.  For the next fortnight Mendaka invited the Buddha and his monks daily to his house, where he fed them.[/p][p]Later, when, at Pasenadi's request, Bimbisāra sent Dhanañjaya to live in Kosala, Visākhā accompanied her parents and lived in Sāketa.  The messengers, sent by Migāra of Sāvatthi to find a suitable bride for his son Paññavaddhana, saw Visākhā on her way to the lake to bathe on a feast day.  At that moment there was a great shower.  Visākhā's companions ran for shelter, but Visākhā herself, walking at her usual pace, came to the place where the messengers, already greatly impressed, were awaiting her.  When they asked her why she did not run to seek shelter and so preserve her clothes, she answered that she had plenty of clothes in the house, but that if she ran she might damage a limb which would be a great loss.  "Unmarried girls," she said, "are like goods awaiting sale, they must not be disfigured." The messengers offered her a bouquet of flowers (mālāgulam), which she accepted as a proposal of marriage, and then went on to her father's house.  The messengers followed and laid Punnavaddhana's suit before Dhanañjaya.  The proposal was accepted and confirmed by an exchange of letters.[/p][p]When Pasenadi heard of it, he offered to accompany Punnavaddhana to Sāketa, as a mark of signal favour.  Dhanañjaya welcomed the king and his retinue, Migāra, Punnavaddhana and their followers, with all honour, attending personally to all the details of hospitality.  He persuaded the king to stay with him during the rains, providing all that was necessary.  According to the DhA.  account (loc.  cit.) Visākhā superintended all the arrangements.[/p][p]Five hundred goldsmiths were engaged to make the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahalata_pasadhana,Mahālatāpasādhana')"]Mahālatāpasādhana[/a] (ornament), q.v., for the bride; three months passed, but it was still unfinished.  The supply of firewood ran out, and orders were given that the wood of dilapidated houses should be used.  This wood lasted for a fortnight, and then the storehouses containing cloths were opened, the cloths soaked in oil and used for cooking the food.  The ornament was finished in four months.  In the time of Kassapa Buddha she gave bowls and robes to twenty thousand monks, also thread and needles and sewing materials; as a result of this, she received her parure in this life (DhA.i.395).[/p][p]Dhanañjaya gave his daughter, as dowry, five hundred carts full of money, five hundred with vessels of gold, five hundred each of silver, copper, various silks, ghee, rice husked and winnowed; also ploughs, ploughshares, and other farm implements, five hundred carts with three slave-women in each, everything being provided for them.  The cattle given by him filled an enclosure three quarters of a league in length and eight rods across, standing shoulder to shoulder, and in addition to these, sixty thousand bulls and sixty thousand milk cows escaped from their stalls and joined the herd already gifted to her.  In her birth as Sanghadāsi, she gave the five products of the cow to twenty thousand monks, begging them to eat; hence the escaping of the cattle for her benefit (DhA.i.397).  Visākhā's relations continued to send her costly gifts even after her marriage.  The Udāna (ii.9) contains a story of a dispute she had with the customs officers regarding the duty they levied on one of her presents.  She visited Pasenadi several times, trying to get the matter settled; but he had no time to give to the matter, and, in the end, she sought consolation from the Buddha.[/p][p]When the time came for Visākhā to leave, Dhanañjaya gave her ten admonitions, which Migāra overheard from the next room.  These admonitions were: Not to give fire from the house outside; not to take into the house fire from without; to give only to those who give in return: not to give to those who do not give in return; to give to him that gives and to him that gives not; to sit, eat and sleep happily; to tend the fire and to honour household deities.  These riddles were later explained by Visākhā to her father in law (DhA.i.403f.).[/p][p]On the following day Dhanañjaya appointed eight householders to be sponsors to his daughter and to enquire into any charges which might be brought against her.  When she left, Dhanañjaya allowed any inhabitants of his fourteen tributary villages to accompany her if they so wished.  As a result the villages were left empty; but Migāra, fearing that he should have to feed them, drove most of them back.  Visākhā entered Sāvatthi standing in her chariot, so that all might see her glory.  The citizens showered gifts on her, but these she distributed among the people.[/p][p]Migāra was a follower of the Niganthas, and, soon after Visākhā's arrival in his house, he sent for them and told her to minister to them.  But Visākhā, repulsed by their nudity, refused to pay them homage.  The Niganthas urged that she should be sent away, but Migāra bided his time.  One day, as Migāra was eating, while Visākhā stood fanning him, a monk was seen standing outside his house.  Visākhā stood aside, that Migāra might see him, but as Migāra continued to eat without noticing the monk, she said to the latter, "Pass on, Sir, my father in law eats stale fare." Migāra was angry and threatened to send her away, but, at her request, the matter was referred to her sponsors.  They enquired into the several charges brought against her and adjudged her not guilty.  Visākhā then gave orders that preparations should be made for her return to her parents.  But Migāra begged her forgiveness which she granted, on condition that he would invite to the house the Buddha and his monks.  This he did, but, owing to the influence of the Niganthas, he left Visākhā to entertain them, and only consented to hear the Buddha's sermon at the end of the meal from behind a curtain.  At the conclusion of this sermon, however, he became a sotāpanna.  His gratitude towards Visākhā was boundless; henceforth she was to be considered as his mother and to receive all the honour due to a mother; from this time onwards she was called Migāramātā.  In DhA.i.406 we are told that in order to confirm this declaration, Migāra sucked the breast of Visākhā.  This account adds that she had also a son named Migāra; thus there was a double reason for the name.  AA.i.313 says that Migāra was her eldest son.[/p][p]Migāra got made for her everyday use an ornament called ghanamatthaka, at a cost of one hundred thousand.  (Some time after, Visākhā sold the Matālatāpasādhana and built the Migāramātupāsada.) On the day of the presentation of this ornament, Migāra held for her a special festival in her honour, and she was made to bathe in sixteen pots of perfumed water.  This account of Visākhā is summarized from DhA.i.384ff.; AA.i.219ff.  contains a similar account but with far less detail.  The DhA.  account contains numerous other particulars, some of which are given below.[/p][p]Visākhā had ten sons and ten daughters, each of whom had a similar number of children, and so on down to the fourth generation.  Before her death, at the age of one hundred and twenty, she had eighty four thousand and twenty direct lineal descendants, all living.  (But see Ud.viii.8, which speaks of the death of a grand daughter and of Visākhā's great grief; this evidently refers to Dattā).  She herself kept, all her life, the appearance of a girl of sixteen.  She had the strength of five elephants, and it is said that once she took the trunk of an elephant, which was sent to test her, between her two fingers and forced him back on his haunches (DhA.i.409).  Visākhā owned such a great reputation for bringing good fortune that the people of Sāvatthi always invited her to their houses on festivals and holidays (Ibid.).[/p][p]Visākhā fed five hundred monks daily at her house.  (Thus, e.g., J.iv.144; two thousand, according to DhA.i.128; later she appointed her grand daughter, probably Dattā, to officiate for her.) In the afternoon she visited the Buddha, and, after listening to his sermon, would go round the monastery inquiring into the needs of the monks and nuns (*1).  In these rounds she was sometimes accompanied by Suppiyā (*2).  Visākhā begged for, and was granted, eight boons by the Buddha: that as long as she lived she be allowed to give robes to the members of the Order for the rainy season; food for monks coming into Sāvatthi (*3); food for those going out; food for the sick; food for those who wait on the sick; medicine for the sick; a constant supply of rice gruel for any needing it; and bathing robes for the nuns (*4).[/p][p]With the construction of the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/migaramatupasada,Mīgāramātupāsāda')"]Mīgāramātupāsāda[/a] (q.v.) in the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pubbarama,Pubbārāma')"]Pubbārāma[/a] Visākhā's ambitions were fulfilled, and it is said (DhA.i.416f) that when the monastery was completed and the festival of opening in progress, as the evening drew on she walked round the monastery accompanied by her children, her grandchildren and her great grandchildren, and in five stanzas sang her joy, saying, "Now is entirely fulfilled the prayer which I prayed in times of yore." (The wishes mentioned in these stanzas as having been fulfilled differ from the eight boons mentioned above).  The monks heard her sing and told the Buddha; he related to them how, in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Visākhā had been the friend of the principal women benefactors of that Buddha.  In the time of Kassapa Buddha she was Sanghadāsī, youngest of the seven daughters of Kiki, and for long after her marriage she gave alms and performed other good works with her sisters.  (AA.i.219).[/p][hr][blockquote][p](*1) Because she wished the Sangha well she was appointed on the committee set up to enquire into the charge of misbehaviour brought against the mother of Kumārakassapa (q.v.); Visākhā's experience as the mother of several children stood her in good stead.[/p][p](*2) For an incident connected with one of these visits, see Suppiyā.  DhA.  (i.  100f.) says that once five hundred young men of good family entrusted the care of their wives to Visākhā.  On one occasion, when accompanying her to the monastery, they became drunk and committed improprieties in the presence of the Buddha.  The Buddha frightened them by emitting a dark blue ray of light, thus restoring them to their senses.  This was the occasion of the preaching of the Kumbha Jātaka; see also J.v.11f.[/p][p](*3) Probably on account of this boon the monks who had been to see Khadiravaniya Revata (q.v.) visited Visākhā immediately after their return to Sāvatthi; but see the Pītha Jātaka.[/p][p](*4) This list of boons and Visākhā's reasons for begging them are given at Vin.i.290ff.  According to the Suruci Jātaka (q.v.), she obtained the boons owing to her virtue in the past as well e.g., in her birth as Sumedhā (J.iv.315ff.); see also Vin.i.296, where the Buddha accepts a face towel as a special gift from Visākhā but would not accept an earthenware foot scrubber (Vin.ii.129f.).[/p][/blockquote][hr][p]According to the Vihāravimānavatthu (Vv.iv.6; VvA.189,191), Visākhā was born, after death, among the Nimmānaratidevā as the consort of the deva king Sunimmita.  [/p][p]Buddhaghosa says (DA.iii.740) that Visākhā, like Sakka and Anāthapindika, will enjoy one hundred and thirty one kappas of happiness in the Brahma-worlds before she finally passes away into nibbāna.[/p][p]Among Visākhā's relations are also mentioned, in addition to her two sons Migajāla and Migāra, a sister Sujātā, who became Anāthapindika's daughter in law (A.iv.91; AA.ii.724; J.ii.347); a grandson, Salha (q.v.); a granddaughter, Dattā, who died (DhA.iii.278): and Uggaha (q.v.), called Mendakanattā.  Mention is also made of a grandson of hers on whose behalf she interceded with the Buddha when the monks refused to ordain him during the rainy season.  (Vin.i.153)[/p][p]The books contain numerous suttas preached by the Buddha to Visākhā during her frequent visits to him, chief among such suttas being the famous discourse on the keeping of the uposatha, (A.i.205ff.; cf.iv.255; DhA.iii.58f) the discourse of the eight qualities which win for women power in this world and power and happiness in the next, (A.iv.269) and eight qualities which win for a woman birth among the Manāpakāyika devas.

After he became an anāgāmī his behaviour to his wife completely changed, and when he explained to her the reason, offering her all his wealth and freedom to do as she wished, she asked his leave to join the Order.  Visākha informed Bimbisāra of her wish, and, at his request, the king ordered that the city be decked in her honour on the day of her renunciation and that she be taken to the nunnery in a golden palanquin.[/p][p]After Dhammadinnā had joined the Order, she left the city and retired into the country, returning to Rājagaha after she had attained arahantship.  Visākha, hearing of her return, visited her at the nunnery and asked her various questions regarding the Buddha's teachings, all of which she answered (MA.i.514f.; ThigA.15, 19).  Their conversation is recorded in the [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cuula_vedalla_s,Culla Vedalla Sutta')"]Culla Vedalla Sutta[/a] (M.i.299f.; cf.  DhA.iv.229f.; AA.i.197).

(For details see PvA.20ff.; of.  KhpA.202f.; DhA.i.86f.  AA.i.144f.) Visākha had been the treasurer, appointed by the three sons of Jayasena, in charge of the provisions given by them for the almsgiving held in honour of Phussa Buddha and his monks.[/p][p]Visākha is mentioned (SA.iii.223) as one of the seven lay disciples in the time of the Buddha who had each five hundred followers.[/p][hr][p][b]2.

(AA.ii.511 calls him the son of Pañcālibrāhmanī).  He succeeded his father, and, hearing one day that the Buddha had arrived near his village, he visited him, heard him preach and joined the Order.  He then accompanied the Buddha to Sāvatthi, where he became an arahant.  Later, out of compassion, he visited his relations.[/p][p]One day he was asked how many qualities were necessary to a man in order that he should be considered a skilful preacher of the Dhamma.  Visākha's answer is included in the Theragāthā (Thag.  vs.  209 10; ThagA.i.331f).[/p][p]Fourteen kappas ago he was a poor householder, and one day, while searching in the forest for fruit, he saw a Pacceka Buddha and offered him a vallī fruit.  He is evidently to be identified with Valliphaladāyaka of the Apadāna (Ap.i.296).[/p][p]Visākha was evidently a clever and arresting preacher, and the books mention that the Buddha heard him preach and praised him.

He had to spend one month at the port waiting for a ship, and, during that time, made one thousand by his skill in trade.  Arrived at the Mahāvihāra, he asked to be ordained, and when, at the time of his ordination, the money was discovered, he distributed it among those who were present.  After five years he set out travelling, and, with the help of a devatā, found his way to Cittalapabbata vihāra, where he stayed for four months.  As he was about to leave, the devatā of the jambu tree which stood at the head of his cankamana appeared before him weeping, and explained that while the Thera was there the nonhumans lived in peace, but that when he had gone they would start quarrelling and talking loudly.  Several times he tried to leave but was thus prevented, until, at last, he became an arahant and died there.  Vsm.i.312f; the story is referred to at AA.ii.865.[/p][hr][p][b]4.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Vidūdabha[/div][p]Son of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasenadi,Pasenadi')"]Pasenadi[/a] and [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaasabhakkhattiyaa,Vāsabhakhattiyā')"]Vāsabhakhattiyā[/a].  On the birth of Vidūdabha, the king, glad at having a son, sent word to his own grandmother asking her to choose a name.  The minister who delivered the message was deaf, and when the grandmother spoke of Vāsabhakhattiyā as being dear to the king, mistook "vallabha" for "Vidūdabha," and, thinking that this was an old family name, bestowed it on the prince.  When the boy was quite young, Pasenadi conferred on him the rank of senāpati, thinking that this would please the Buddha.  It was for the same reason he married Vāsabhakhattiyā; both in the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/piyajatika_sutta,Piyajātika Sutta')"]Piyajātika Sutta[/a] (M.ii.110) and the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kannakatthala_s,Kannakatthala Suttas')"]Kannakatthala Suttas[/a] (M.ii.127) Vidūdabha is spoken of as senāpati.[/p][p]When Vidūdabha was seven years old, he wished to visit his maternal grandparents, hoping to be given presents, like his companions by theirs, but Vāsabhakhattiyā persuaded him against this, telling him that they lived too far away.  But he continued to express this desire, and when he reached the age of sixteen she consented to his going.  Thereupon, accompanied by a large retinue, he set out for Kapilavatthu.  The Sākiyans sent all the younger princes away, there being thus none to pay obeisance to him in answer to his salute, the remaining ones being older than he.  He was shown every hospitality and stayed for several days.  On the day of his departure, one of his retinue overheard a contemptuous remark passed by a slave woman who was washing, with milk and water, the seat on which Vidūdabha had sat.  This was reported to him, and, having discovered the deceit which had been practiced on his father, he vowed vengeance on the Sākiyans.  Pasenadi cut off all honours from Vāsabhakhattiyā and her son, but restored them later, at the Buddha's suggestion.[/p][p]After Pasenadi's death, which was brought about by the treachery of Dīghakārāyana in making Vidūdabha king (for details see Pasenadi), Vidūdabha remembered his oath, and set out with a large army for Kapilavatthu.  The Buddha, aware of this, stood under a tree, with scanty shade, just within the boundaries of the Sākiyan kingdom.  On the boundary was a banyan which gave deep shade.  Vidūdabha, seeing the Buddha, asked him to sit under the banyan.  "Be not worried," said the Buddha, "the shade of my kinsmen keeps me cool.” Vidūdabha understood and returned home with his army.  This exposure to the sun gave the Buddha a headache which lasted through out his life (UdA.265; Ap.i.300).[/p][p]Three times he marched against the Sākiyans and three times he saw the Buddha under the same tree and turned back.  The fourth time the Buddha knew that the fate of the Sākiyans could not be averted and remained away.  In a previous existence they had conspired and thrown poison into a river.[/p][p]The Sākiyans went armed into the battle, but not wishing to kill, they shot their arrows into Vidūdabha's ranks without killing anyone.  On this being brought to Vidūdabha's notice, he gave orders that all the Sākiyans, with the exception of the followers of the Sākiyan Mahānāma, should be slain.  The Sākiyans stood their ground, some with blades of grass and some with reeds.  These were spared, and came to be known as Tinasākyā and Nalasākiyā respectively.*[/p][p]The others were all killed, even down to the infants.  Mahānāma was taken prisoner and went back with Vidūdabha, who wished him to share his meal.  But Mahānāma said he wished to bathe, and plunged into a lake with the idea of dying rather than eating with a slave woman's child.  The Nāgas of the lake, however, saved him and took him to the Nāga world.  That same night Vidūdabha pitched his camp on the dry bed of the Aciravatī.  Some of his men lay on the banks, others on the river bed.  Some of those who lay on the river bed were not guilty of sin in their past lives, while some who slept on the bank were.  Ants appeared on the ground where the sinless ones lay, and they changed their sleeping places.  During the night there was a sudden flood, and Vidūdabha and those of his retinue who slept in the river bed were washed into the sea.  This account is taken from DhA.i.346 9, 357 61; but see also J.i.133 and iv.146f., 151f.[/p][hr][p]* According to Chinese records, Vidūdabha took five hundred Sākyan maidens into his harem, but they refused to submit to him and abused him and his family.  He ordered them to be killed, their hands and feet to be cut off, and their bodies thrown into a ditch.  The Buddha sent a monk to preach to them, and they were reborn after death in heaven.  Sakra collected their bones and burnt them (Beal, op.  cit.ii.11f.).  The eleventh Pallava of the Avadānakalpalatā has a similar story.  Vidūdabha killed seventy seven thousand Sākiyans and stole eighty thousand boys and girls.  The girls were rude to him, and he ordered their death.[/p]</e>

"A time will come for that, sister," he said, and went away.  Three times this happened, and then she told her pupil.  He pointed out to her her mistake in not showing respect for the Doctrine.  The next time Udāyī came, she approached him after the meal with all humility and asked him what, according to the arahants, was the cause of weal and woe.  "The existence of the senses," answered Udāyī; and she, expressing her satisfaction, declared herself a follower of Udāyī.  S.iv.121f.[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Verañjā[/div][p]A town in which the Buddha once spent the rainy season at the invitation of the brahmin Verañja.  (In the twelfth year, according to Buddhaghosa e.g., AA.ii.758; cf.  BuA.3).  Verañja visits the Buddha at the foot of the Nalerupicumanda, where he is staying, and asks him a series of questions, the first of which is: whether it be true that the Buddha pays no respect to aged brahmins.  The Buddha replies that he has not seen a brahmin in the whole world to whom such respect is due from him.  If the Tathāgata were so to honour anyone, that person's head would split in pieces.  Other questions follow on the Buddha's doctrine and practices.  The Buddha concludes by giving an account of his attainment of the threefold knowledge.  The interview ends with the conversion of Verañja and his invitation to the Buddha to spend his rainy season there.  Here he spoke of the Vijjāttaya, says UdA.(p.  183), because all the monks with the Buddha were chalabhiññā, and therefore no special mention was needed of abhiññā.[/p][p]At that time there was a famine, and five hundred householders of Uttarāpatha, staying at Verañjā, supplied the monks with food.  Moggallāna proposed to get food by the exercise of his magic power or by going with the monks to Uttarakuru, but he was dissuaded by the Buddha.  During this stay Sāriputta received from the Buddha an explanation as to why the religious systems of the three previous Buddhas lasted so long, while those of the three preceding them - Vipassī, Sikhī and Vesabhū- did not.[/p][p]At the conclusion of the vassa, the Buddha wished to take leave of Verañja before setting out, as was the custom of Buddhas when they received hospitality.  Verañja admitted that, though he had invited the Buddha, he had not kept his promise, and this was due to his having too many duties in the house.  The Commentators add that Verañja forgot his invitation because Māra, being in a spiteful mood, had taken possession of him and of all the inhabitants of Verañja (Sp.i.178 L; DhA.ii.153; cf.  J.iii.494).[/p][p]He invited the Buddha and the monks to a meal the next day, and, at the end of the meal, presented a set of three robes to the Buddha and a pair to each of the monks.[/p][p]After leaving Verañjā the Buddha went to Benares, passing through Soreyya, Sankassa and Kannakujja, and crossing the Ganges at Payāgapatitthāna.  From Benares he proceeded to Vesāli.  This account, of the Buddha's visit to Verañja, forms the introduction to the Vinaya and is found at Vin.iii.1 11. The interview with Verañja is given at A.iv.172ff.  The road taken by the Buddha from Verañjā to Benares was, according to Buddhaghosa (Sp.i.201), the shortest, and the Buddha knew the monks were tired after their experiences in Verañjā.  Soon after, he appears to have visited Kapilavatthu.  There he was visited by Mahānāma, the Sākyan, who asked permission to entertain him and the monks for four months that they might recover their strength.  At the end of the four months he renewed his request, and thus looked after the monks for a whole year.  It was this act that won for him the title of aggo panītadāyakānam (A.A.i.213).[/p][p]It is said (SNA.i.154; Mil.  232) that the devas put flavour (ojā) into every mouthful of food taken by the Buddha at Verañjā.  According to the Apadāna (Ap.i.301; ApA.i.103f.; cf.  UdA.265), the Bodhisatta was born of a noble house in the time of Phussa Buddha, and, once, seeing the monks eating good food, he had reviled them and asked them to eat oats (yava).  It was for this reason the Buddha was condemned to eat yava during three months at Verañjā.[/p][p]A road led from Verañjā to Madhurā, and the Anguttara Nikāya (A.ii.57f) contains a sermon preached by the Buddha to a large number of people while he rested by the roadside.  There was evidently frequent intercourse between Sāvatthi and Verañjā, and the Verañjaka Sutta (q.v.) was preached to some brahmins who visited the Buddha at Sāvatthi, whither they had gone on business.  The books also record (A.iv.198f ) a visit paid by the Asura Pahārāda to the Buddha at Verañjā.  The Vālodaka Jātaka (q.v.) and the Cullasuka Jātaka (q.v.) were preached soon after the Buddha's return from Verañjā.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Asandhimittā[/div][p]Chief queen of Dhammāsoka.  He gave for her use one of the eight loads of water brought for him from Anotatta (Mhv.v.85; two says Sp.i.42).  She was a faithful follower of the Buddha's teaching and died in the thirtieth year of Asoka's reign (Mhv.xx.2).  When preparations were being made to take the branch of the Bodhi-tree to Ceylon, she offered to the tree all kinds of ornaments and various sweet-scented flowers (Mbv.152).[/p][p][/p][p]Having learnt from the monks that the voice of the karavīka bird was like that of the Buddha, she had a karavīka given her by the king, and listened to his song.  Thrilled with joy at the thought of the sweetness of the Buddha's voice, she attained to the First Fruit of the Path (DA.ii.453; MA.ii.771).[/p][p][/p][p]She was called Asandhimittā because the joints in her limbs were visible only when she bent or stretched them (MT.136).[/p][p]In a previous birth, when Asoka was born as a honey merchant and gave honey to the Pacceka Buddha, she was the maid who pointed out the honey-store to the Pacceka Buddha.  She had then wished that she might become the queen consort of the King of Jambudīpa and be possessed of a lovely form with invisible joints.  Mhv.v.59-60.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Arindama[/div][hr][p][b]1. Arindama.[/b]-The Bodhisatta, born as King of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"]Benares[/a] and son of the Magadha King of Rājagaha.  During the time of Sikhī Buddha he held a great almsgiving for the Buddha and his monks; he presented to the Order a fully caparisoned elephant which he redeemed by giving suitable gifts to the height of an elephant (J.i.41; Bu.xxi.9).  He had as friend the chaplain's son, Sonaka.  They both studied in Takkasilā and at the conclusion of their studies they travelled about in search of experience.  In the course of their travels Arindama was elected to succeed the King of Benares who had died childless, and Sonaka became a Pacceka Buddha.  Forty years later Arindama wished to see Sonaka, but no one could tell him his whereabouts in spite of the offer of a large reward.  Ten years later Sonaka saw the king through the good offices of a lad of seven, who belonged to the harem and had learnt a song composed by the king expressing his desire to meet Sonaka.  At the meeting, however, the king failed to recognise him.  Sonaka, not revealing his identity, spoke to the king about the joys of renunciation, and disappeared through the air.  The king, moved by his words, decided to give up the throne and to follow the ascetic life.  He appointed his eldest son Dīghāvu king in his stead, handed over to him all his possessions, and developing supernatural faculties was born in the Brahma world (J.v.247-61).[/p][p]Arindama is mentioned together with Mahājanaka as an example of a king who renounced a mighty kingdom to lead a hermit's life (J.iii.489).  The story also appears in the Mahāvastu (iii.449ff), but the details given differ from those of the Jātaka version.  There Arindama is spoken of as the King of Mithilā.[/p][p]In both accounts Dīghāvu's mother, the king's chief queen, is spoken of as having died before the king's renunciation.[/p][p]According to the Buddhavamsa Commentary (BuA.203), Arindama's capital was Paribhuttanagara.

A great dispute had arisen at this time regarding nirodha and all the inhabitants of many thousand world systems were divided into two camps.  In order to settle their doubts, the disputants, with Arindama at their head, sought the Buddha.  The Buddha sat on Mount Yugandhara while Arindama, with his ninety thousand crores of followers, sat on a golden rock, which by the power of his merit had sprung from the earth near Sankassa.  The Buddha preached to them, and at the end of the sermon they all became arahants.  BuA.128-9.[/p][hr][p][b]3. Arindama.[/b]-King of Uttara.  When Revata Buddha visited his city the king went to see him, accompanied by three crores of people.

The Buddha preached to the assembly, and one thousand crores of people realised the Truth.  Bu.vi.4; BuA.133.[/p][hr][p][b]4.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Aruna[/div][hr][p]1. Aruna.-A khattiya, father of Sikhī Buddha and husband of Pabhāvatī (Bu.xxi.15; J.i.41; AA.i.436).  Aruna's chief queen became the Therī Abhayā in the present age (ThigA.41).  Another of his wives became, in her last life, the Therī Somā (ThigA.66), who is perhaps to be identified with Uppaladāyikā of the Apadāna (Ap.ii.601f).  In the Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.155) he is called Arunavā.[/p][p][/p][p]2. Aruna.-The Assaka king of Potali in the Assaka country.  (In the main story the king's name is given as Assaka, but the scholiast says his real name was Aruna).  The Kālinga king of that time, longing for a fight, but finding no one willing to accept his challenge, at last devised a plan.  He sent his four beautiful daughters, in a covered carriage and with an armed escort to the various cities in the neighbourhood, proclaiming that any king, who took them as wives, would have to fight their father.  No one was found willing to take the risk till they came to Potali in the Assaka country.  Even the Assaka king at first merely sent them a present by way of courtesy, but his minister, Nandisena, fertile in expedients, urged the king to marry them, saying that he himself would undertake to face the consequences.  The Kālinga king at once set out with his army.  On his way to Potali, he came across the Bodhisatta, who was leading the ascetic life and, without revealing his identity, consulted him regarding his chances of success in the fight.  The Bodhisatta promised that he would see Sakka about it the next day and, having done so, informed the king that the Kālinga forces would win.  Nandisena heard of this prophecy but, nothing daunted, he gathered together the Assaka forces and all their allies; then, by a well-planned manoeuvre, he managed to have the tutelary deity of Kālinga (who was fighting for the Kālinga king) killed by Assaka.  Thereupon the Kālinga king was routed and fled.  The Bodhisatta, finding that his prophecy had turned out false, sought Sakka in his distress; Sakka consoled him thus: "Hast thou never heard that even the gods favour the bold hero of intrepid resolve, who never yields?"[/p][p]Later, at the suggestion of Nandisena, the Assaka king demanded of Kālinga's ruler dowry for his four daughters, and the Kālinga king acceded to his request.  The story is told in the Kālinga Jātaka (J.iii.3ff.).[/p][p][/p][p]3. Aruna.-The pleasaunce near Anupama where the Buddha Vessabhu first preached to his chief disciples, Sona and Uttara.

Five hundred brahmins staying in the city asked him to hold a discussion with the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"]Buddha[/a] and refute his views.  He agreed only after repeated requests, because, he said,  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gotama,Gotama')"]Gotama[/a] was a thinker with views of his own and, therefore, difficult to defeat in controversy.

He declares himself a follower of the Buddha (M.ii.147ff).  Buddhaghosa (MA.ii.785) tells us further that Assalāyana became a devoted follower of the faith and built a cetiya in his own residence for worship, and that all his descendants, down to Buddhaghosa's day, built similar cetiyas in their houses.[/p][p]Assalāyana is probably to be identified with the father of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kotthita,Mahākotthita')"]Mahākotthita[/a], his wife being Candavati.  There is, however, one difficulty connected with this theory: Mahākotthita says that he was won over to the faith after hearing the same sermon of the Buddha as converted his father (yadā me pitaram Buddho vinayī sabbasuddhiyā) (ThagA.i.31; Ap.ii.480).  It is unlikely, if the identification be correct, that this refers to the Assalāyana Sutta, because at the time of that Sutta, Assalāyana was only sixteen years old; but there exists no record of any other sutta preached to Assalāyana, dealing with "sabbasuddhi."[/p][p]Assalayāna's name occurs in a list of eminent brahmins found in the Sutta-Nipāta Commentary (i.372).[/p][hr][p][b]Assalāyana Sutta[/b].-Records the conversation between the Buddha and Assalāyana when the latter went to visit him.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Ariyapariyesanā Sutta[/div][p]Preached in Sāvatthi in the hermitage of the brahmin Rammaka.  Some monks expressed to Ananda their desire to hear a discourse from the Buddha, as it was so long since they had heard one.  He advised them to go to the hermitage of Rammaka where their wishes might be fulfilled.  The noontide of that same day Amanda spent with the Buddha at the Pubbārāma in the Migāramātupāsāda and in the evening, after the Buddha had bathed in the Pubbakotthaka, Ananda suggested to him that he might go to Rammaka's hermitage.  The Buddha assenting, they went together.  The Buddha, finding the monks engaged in discussing the Doctrine, waited till their discussion was over.  Having inquired the topic thereof, he praised them and proceeded to tell them of the two quests in the world-the noble and the ignoble.  He described how he, too, before his Enlightenment, had followed the quest, apprenticing himself to various teachers, such as Ālāva-Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta, and how, on discovering that they could not give him what he sought, he went to Uruvelā and there found the consummate peace of Nibbāna.  This biographical account is also found in the Mahā-Saccaka, Bodhirājakumāra and Sangārava-Suttas.  It is in part repeated in the Vinaya and the Digha Nikāya.[/p][p][/p][p]The Sutta then proceeds to give an account of the Buddha's first reluctance to preach, of Sahampati's intervention, of the meeting with the Ājivaka Upaka and the first sermon preached to the Pañcavaggiyas.  Finally the sutta expounds the pleasures of the senses, the dangers therefrom and the freedom and confidence which ensue when one has overcome desire (M.i.160-75).[/p][p][/p][p]In the Commentary (MA.i.369ff) the sutta is called Pāsarāsi, evidently because of the simile found at the end of the discourse where the pleasures of the senses are compared to baited traps.[/p][p]The Atthasālinī quotes it (p.35).[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Asokamālā[/div][p]The wife of Prince Sāli.  She was a candāla woman of exceedingly great beauty, and the prince married her, thus renouncing his right to the throne (Mhv.xxiii.2-4).  The two had been husband and wife, named Tissa and Nagā, in a previous existence and had lived in Mundagangā in Ceylon.  One day the husband received a pig from a hunter in payment of some smith's work he had done.  Having prepared the animal for food, he expressed the wish that eight holy monks might come to accept alms from him.  His wife joining him in this wish, they decorated the house, prepared eight seats, strewed the village path with sand and awaited the guests.  Dhammadinna Thera of Piyangudīpa, having divined the man's wish, came to the village with seven colleagues.  After they had eaten, they gave thanks and went away.  The man was born as Sāli the son of Dutthagāmani, but his wife was born as a candāla as punishment for an offence in another existence.  She had been the youngest of seven daughters of a carpenter and was one day scolded by her mother for untidiness.  In anger she used to her mother the same abusive terms as had been hurled at her.  This undutiful behaviour caused her to be born as the daughter of a candāla.  MT.606 f.[/p][p][/p][p]Her name was Devī, and her father was the chief candāla in Hallolagāma.

After his education at Takkasilā his parents wished him to marry.  After much persuasion he agreed to do so, if they could find a woman like a golden image which he would make.  Emissaries were sent out and they found a girl of sixteen, Samīllabhāsinī, in the Kāsi kingdom.  She did not wish to marry either, but yielded to her parent's wishes.  Though the two young people were married they lived in celibacy and when their parents died they gave away their immense wealth and became ascetics.  Samillabhāsini died of dysentery caused by unsatisfactory meals.  The Bodhisatta coming back from his begging-rounds found her dead on a bench, but proceeded to eat his meal much to the surprise of the onlookers.  On being questioned, "Why should I weep?" he said "that which has the quality of dissolution is dissolved."[/p][p][/p][p]The story was related in reference to a landowner who, when his wife died, gave himself up to despair.

In the Commentaries three etymologies are given: Buddhaghosa says that "it means emitting rays of various hues from the body," and that the word is therefore applicable to all Buddhas alike (DA.iii.963).  Dhammapāla adds that it signifies being possessed of attainments such as virtue, and also that according to some, Angirasa was a personal name given by the Buddha's father in addition to Siddhatha (ThagA.i.503. It is worth noting that in AA.i.381 Siddhattha is referred to as Angīrasa Kumāra.) [/p][p]It is, however, well-known that, according to Vedic tradition, the Gautamas belong to the Angirasa tribe (see Vedic Index: Gotama); the word, as applied to the Buddha, therefore, is probably a patronymic, in which case we have another example of a Ksatriya tribe laying claim to a brahmin gotra.

His wife was Visākhā and his son Sena (Sela according to the Buddhavamsa Commentary).  He lived for 10,000 years as a householder in three palaces - Amaragiri, Suragiri and Girivāhana.  He left home on a horse called Sudassana.  His penance lasted eight months, and his meal of milk-rice was given by a nāga woman, Sucindharā.  A nāga, Dhammaruci, gave him the grass which he spread at the foot of the campaka tree, where he reached Enlightenment.  His first sermon was preached in the Anomā-park near Anoma.  His chief disciples were Santa, the king's son, and Upasanta, son of the chaplain of Sucandaka.  His chief women disciples were Dhammā and Sudhammā.  Abhaya was his attendant, and his patrons were Nakula and Nisabha among the laymen, and Makilā and Sunandā among the lay-women.  The Bodhisatta was a jatila, Susīma of Campaka, and he offered the Buddha a canopy of flowers brought from the deva-world.

Four channels open out of the lake in the direction of the four quarters: Sīhamukha, Hatthimukha, Assamukha and Usabhamukha.  Lions abound on the banks of the Sīhamukha; elephants, horses and cattle respectively on the others.  Four rivers flow from these channels; the eastward river encircles the lake three times, waters the non-human regions of Himavā and enters the ocean.  The rivers that flow north and westward flow in those directions through regions inhabited by non-humans and also enter the ocean.  The southward river, like the eastward, flows three times round the lake and then straight south over a rocky channel for sixty leagues and then down a precipice, forming a cascade six miles in width.  For sixty leagues the water dashes through the air on to a rock named Tiyaggala, whereon by the force of the impact of the waters the Tiyaggalapokkharani has been formed, fifty leagues deep.  From this lake the waters run through a rocky chasm for sixty leagues, then underground for sixty leagues to an oblique mountain, Vijjha, where the stream divides into five, like the fingers of the hand.  The part of this river which encircles the original lake Anotatta is called Āvattagangā; the sixty leagues of stream which run over the rocky channel, Kanhagangā; the sixty leagues of waterfall in the air, Ākāsagangā; the sixty leagues flowing out of the Tiyaggala-pokkharanī and through the rocky gorge is called Bahalagangā, and the river underground, Ummaggagangā.  The five streams into which the river is divided after leaving the oblique mountain Vijjha are called Gangā, Yamunā, Aciravatī, Sarabhū and Mahī (SnA.ii.407; 437-9; MA.ii.585f.; AA.ii.759-60).[/p][p][/p][p]A wind called Siñcanakavāta (sprinkling wind) takes water from the Anotatta lake and sprinkles the Gandhamādana mountain with it (SnA.i.66).  The lake is one of the last to dry up at the end of the world (A.iv.101).  To be bathed in the waters of the lake is to be thoroughly cleansed.  Thus the Buddha's mother, on the day of her conception, dreamt that she had been taken to the lake and had bathed there.  This was interpreted to mean that she would give birth to a holy son (MA.ii.918).[/p][p]During periods when the world does not possess a Buddha, the Pacceka Buddhas, who dwell in Gandhamādana, come amongst men and wash their faces in the lake before starting on their aerial journey for Isipatana (MA.i.386) or elsewhere (E.g., J.iii.319, iv.368).  The Buddha would often go to Anotatta for his ablutions and proceed from there to Uttarakuru for alms, returning to the lake to have his meal and spend the hot part of the day on its banks.  E.g., before his visit to Uruvelakassapa (Vin.i.28); and again during the three months he spent in Tāvatimsa (DhA.iii.222); see also J.i.80.[/p][p]Examples are given of other holy men doing the same.  E.g., Mātangapandita, J.iv.379; see also DhA.ii.211.[/p][p][/p][p]There are many bathing-places in the lake; those for the Buddhas, Pacceka Buddhas, monks, ascetics, the Four Regent gods and other inhabitants of the deva-worlds, and for the goddesses, were all separate from each other.  In the bathing-place of the goddesses there once arose a dispute between Kālakannī and Sirī as to which should bathe first (J.iii.257ff).  Other instances are given of goddesses bathing in the lake and resting on the banks of the Manosilātala next to it (E.g., J.v.392).[/p][p][/p][p]It was considered the summit of iddhi-power to be able to obtain water from Anotatta.  Thus, when the Buddha wished to make known the great powers of Sumana-Sāmanera, he expressed a desire to have water fetched from the lake in which to wash his feet; no one was willing or able to fetch it except the novice Sumana (DhA.iv.134ff).  And Sona, to show his iddhi to the 101 kings who escorted his brother Nanda to his hermitage, brought water from Anotatta for them and for their retinue (J.v.320-1).  To provide water from the lake for the personal use of some eminent person is considered one of the best ways of showing him esteem.  Thus, when a friendship was established between the king of the swans, Javahamsa, and the king of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"]Benares[/a], the former brought the famous water from Anotatta to the king for his ablutions (J.iv.213).  Pannaka, the Nāga king of Anotatta, promised to supply water to Sumana-Sāmanera as amends for his earlier discourtesy (DhA.iv.134, also ThagA.457 where the story is given in detail); and Nanda, when he wished to ask his brother's forgiveness for disobedience, thought it a good way of showing his repentance to bring him water from the lake (J.v.314).  This water had curative powers; Anuruddha's abdominal affliction was cured by its use (DhA.iv.129).  To be able to use water from Anotatta daily was a great luxury and a sign of real prosperity.  Gods brought to Asoka eight pingo-loads of lake water in sixteen pots for his use (Sp.i.42; Mhv.v.24; 84; xi.30).  Vessavana employed yakkhinis to fetch water for him in turn, each turn lasting for four to five months.  It was exhausting work and some of them died before their term of service was over (DhA.i.40).[/p][p][/p][p]Regular assemblies of the devas and yakkhas were held on the banks of Anotatta, at which contests of skill took place (E.g, among the daughters of Vessavana, demonstrating their ability to dance, VvA.131-2).  Sometimes the Buddha would go there with a company of monks and preach or make proclamations (E.g., Ap.i.299).  Monks would often dwell there in meditation and come when summoned (Dvy.399).[/p][p][/p][p]A mahā-kappa is measured by reckoning the amount of time that would be required to empty the Anotatta lake, by dipping into it a blade of kusa-grass, and shaking out from it one drop of water once in every hundred years (PvA.254).[/p][p]Just as the water of Anotatta, having ultimately entered the ocean through the Ganges, would never turn back, so the Bodhisatta, in his last birth, would never turn back from his purpose of becoming Buddha for the sake of becoming a cakkavatti (Mil.286-7).[/p][p]The Divyavadana speaks of a class of devas who dwelt near Anotatta, whom it calls Anavatapta-kāyikādevatā (p.153).[/p][hr][p][/p][p]2.

But when the Buddha left Sāvatthi and went to Rājagaha they reverted to their old faiths, coming back to the Buddha when he returned to Sāvatthi.[/p][p][/p][p]The story of the past is of two merchants who travel with caravans across a desert.  One, beguiled by goblins, throws away his drinking water and is devoured with all his people and cattle.  The other completes his journey safely, not putting faith in the goblins.  The moral is that the followers of false teachers are led astray.  The foolish merchant was Devadatta (J.i.95ff).

One day a girl came to the hermitage, fleeing from brigands, and corrupted the virtue of the youth.  But when she tried to induce him to go away with her, he wished to consult his father.  The father warned him against leaving the hermitage and taught him the way to mystic meditation (J.iii.147-9).

  <e>[div class="huge"]Asibandhakaputta[/div][p]A gāmani (headman).  He came to the Buddha in the Pārileyyaka Mango Grove in Nālandā and asked him various questions, recorded in the Samyutta Nikāya (iv.312ff).  One of these related to the custom among the Pacchābhumaka (Westlander) brahmins (where, perhaps, he himself belonged) of lifting a man up when dead and carrying him out, calling him by name to speed him heavenward.  Surely the Buddha who is an arahant, etc., could make the whole world go to heaven thus if he chose.  To this the Buddha answers no, and explains, by various similes, that only a man's kamma can determine where he will be reborn.  On another occasion, the Buddha tells him, in answer to a question, that the Buddha teaches the Dhamma in full only to certain disciples and not to others; just as a farmer sowing seed selects, first the best field, then the moderate, and lastly, the field with the worst soil.[/p][p]Asibandhakaputta tells the Buddha that, according to Nigantha Nātaputta (he is described as a Nigantha-Sāvaka, S.iv.317), as a man habitually lives so goes he forth to his destiny.  The Buddha points out the absurdity of this view and tells him that all Tathāgatas lay down definite rules for the guidance of their followers, so that they may attain development.[/p][p]It is recorded (S.iv.322ff) that once, when Nālandā was stricken with famine, Asibandhaka visited Nigantha Nātaputta, who asks him to go and defeat the Buddha in debate.  Asibandhaka is at first reluctant, but his teacher propounds to him a dilemma to put to the Buddha, and he agrees to go.[/p][p]Is it true that the Buddha extols compassion to clansmen? Why, then, does the Buddha ask for alms in a place stricken with famine? The Buddha's answer is that there are eight ways of injuring clansmen, and that begging for alms is not one of them.  And Asibandhakaputta, pleased with the answer, declares himself to be a follower of the Buddha.[/p][p]Asibandhakaputta's conversation with the Buddha, in which the Buddha tells him that only a man's kamma can determine the state of his rebirth, is quoted in the Nettippaka-rana (pp.45-47).[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Asaññasattā[/div][p]Inhabitants of the fifth of the nine abodes of beings (sattāvāsā).  These beings are unconscious and experience nothing (A.iv.401).  As soon as an idea occurs to them they fall from their state (D.i.28).  Brahmin ascetics, having practised continual meditation and attained to the fourth jhāna, seeing the disadvantages attached to thinking, try to do away with it altogether.  Dying in this condition, they are reborn among the Asaññasattā, having form only, but neither sensations, ideas, predispositions nor consciousness.  They last only as long as their power of jhāna; then an idea occurs to them and they die straightaway (DA.i.118).[/p][p]The Andhakas held that these devas were really only sometimes conscious, which belief the Theravādins rejected as being absurd (Kvu.262).[/p][p]The Elder Sobhita was once born among the Asaññasattā and could remember that existence.  These devas are long-lived.  ThagA.i.291.[/p]</e>

The suttas are arranged in numbered lists, probably as aids to memory.  Thus we find set out in order first the units, then the pairs, the trios etc., up to groups of eleven.  This method of arrangement has evidently influenced the subject matter as well, for we seldom see any reasoned arguments.  The lists are often curtly given and curtly explained (See also Hardy's remarks, A.v.  introd.  p.vii).[/p][p]At the first Council Anuruddha was asked to be the custodian of this Nikāya of 120 bhānavāras and to read it to his pupils (DA.i.15; Mbv.94).[/p][p]When the Buddha's religion fades away, the first portion of the Sutta Pitaka to disappear will be the Anguttara Nikāya from the eleventh section to the first, and in that order (MA.881).[/p][p]It was also sometimes called [b]Ekuttara[/b].

  <e>[div class="huge"]Ayojjhā[/div][hr][p]1. Ayojjhā.-A city of the Ganges (but see below in this article).  Two visits of the Buddha to this city are recorded in the Canon; on one occasion he preached the Phena Sutta (S.iii.140ff ) and on the other the Dārukkhandha Sutta (S.iv.179f).  In both these references the city is said to be on the Ganges; the town usually called Ayojjhā (Ayodhya) is certainly not on this river.  The records, therefore, go back either to a confused or an unintelligent tradition (see Thomas: op.  cit., 15; cf.  Sāketa), or may possibly refer to another settlement made by colonists from the original Ayojjhā.  It is worthy of note that in the Dārukkhandha Sutta some of the MSS.  read Kosambī for Ayojjhā.  But even Kosambī (q.v.) was on the Jumnā and not on the Ganges.[/p][p]During the Buddhist period, Ayojjhā on the Sarayū was the capital of Dakkhina Kosala, the janapada roughly corresponding to modern Oudh.  This, the Ayodhyā of the Ramayana, is about a mile from the modern Fyzabad.  In the Jātaka Commentary (J.iv.82) there is a mention of Ayojjhā, which here evidently refers to the city of the Sanskrit epics.  It is called the capital of King Kālasena.  It was besieged by the Andhavenhuputtā, who breached the wall and took the king prisoner.  Having thus subjugated the city, they went to Dvāravatī.[/p][p]The Dīpavamsa (iii.15) mentions Ayujjhanagara as the capital of King Arindama and of fifty-five of his descendants.[/p][p]According to Buddhaghosa (SA.ii.233-4), the people of Ayujjhanagara built for the Buddha a vihāra in a spot surrounded by forest near a curve of the river.  Once a warrior named Jagatipāla, of the race of Rāma, came to Ceylon from Ayojjhā, and having slain Vikkampandu, the heir-apparent to the throne, ruled in Rohana for five years.  Cv.lvi.13ff.[/p][hr][p]2. Ayojjhā.-Capital of Siam.  From there Vijayarājasīha, King of Ceylon, obtained monks for his own country (Cv.xcviii.91f).  A few years later his successor, Kittisirirājasīha, sent an embassy there for the same purpose.[/p][p]The King of Siam showed the embassy every mark of favour and granted them the monks.  The monks, who came from Ayojjhā to Ceylon, re-established the ordination of monks in the Island.  Cv.xcviii.60-139; see also J.R.A.S.  (Ceylon Branch), 1903, No.54, pp.17ff.[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Aranavibhanga Sutta[/div][p]The 139th Sutta of the Majjhima Nikāya.  It was preached at Jetavana and contains a statement and an exposition of the middle path of peace between the two extremes of pleasures of sense - low, ignoble and unprofitable - and self-mortification, also painful and unprofitable.  The path is the Noble Eightfold Path: in preaching the doctrine the preacher should neither appreciate nor depreciate it, he should teach the truth in abstract terms of general principle.  He should not be a tale-teller nor confront anyone with improper remarks; he should speak slowly and not hurriedly; he should neither affect provincialisms in speech nor depart from recognised parlance.[/p][p]At the end of the discourse a young man, Subhūti, is praised because he walked where calm dwelt (M.iii.230-7; MA.ii.977-8).[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Aritthapabbata[/div][p]A mountain in Ceylon half-way between Anurādhapura and Pulatthipuva.  It is identified with modern Ritigala, and is near the modern Habarane in the North-Central Province (Mhv.trans.72, n.3).  Pandukābhaya lived there for seven years, awaiting an opportunity to make war on his uncles, and it was near there that he ultimately defeated them (Mhv.x.63-72).  At the foot of the mountain, Sūratissa built the Makulaka Vihāra (Mhv.xxi.6).  Lañjatissa built a vihāra on the mountain and called it Arittha Vihāra (Mhv.xxxiii.27).[/p][p][/p][p]Jetthatissa occupied the mountain before his fight with Aggabodhi III., and it was there that he organised his forces (Cv.xliv.86).[/p][p]Sena I.  built a monastery on the mountain for the use of the Pamsukulikas and endowed it with large revenues (Cv.l.63).[/p][p]At the present day the place is extremely rich in ruins.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Arimaddana[/div][p]The name given in the Pāli chronicles to the city of Pagan in Burma (Rāmañña) (Bode: op.  cit., 14).  During the time of Parakkamabāhu I.  of Ceylon, the King of Arimaddana quarrelled with him, ill-treated his envoys, and seized by force a princess sent from Ceylon to Kamboja.  Parakkama sent a punitive expedition under the Damilādhikāri Ādicca, who reduced the country to subjection (Cv.lxxvi.10-75).[/p][p][/p][p]Later Vijayabāhu II.  of Ceylon entered into friendly negotiations with the ruler of Arimaddana, and wrote him a letter in the Māgadha language composed by himself.  As a result, a friendly treaty was made between them which also resulted in closer contact between the monks of the two countries (Cv.lxxx.6-8).[/p][p][/p][p]According to some authorities, quoted by Minayeff (Recherches sur Bouddhisme, p.70), the city was full of learned women.  The Gandhavamsa (p.67) mentions a list of twenty-three teachers who wrote their works in Arimaddana.  From this context it appears that Arimaddana was known also as Pukkāma (Pukkāmasankhāte Arimaddananagare).  This is supported by evidence from elsewhere (Forchhammer: Jardine Prize Essay, pp.29, 32. Ind.  Ant.1893, p.17).  It was a minister in Arimaddana who wrote the Nyāsappadīpatīkā (Svd.v.1240).  Arimaddana was also the city of birth of the Thera Chapata (Svd.v.1247).[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Assa Sutta[/div][p]Once Assa, the "Jockey" (assāroha) of Rājagaha came to the Buddha to ask if it were true that a horse-trainer, if he exerted himself in the performance of his duties, would be born among the Sarañjita devas? The Buddha tells him that such a view is a perverted one and that its result is rebirth either in purgatory or as an animal.  Assa expresses his consternation and declares himself thenceforth a follower of the Buddha.  S.iv.310.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Aññāta-Kondañña (Aññā-Kondañña) Thera[/div][p]He was the son of a very wealthy brahmin family of Donavatthu near Kapilavatthu and was born before the Buddha.  He came to be called by his family name Kondañña.  He was learned in the three Vedas, excelling in the science of physiognomy.  [/p][p]When the Buddha was born he was among the eight brahmins (the others being Rāma, Dhaja, Lakkhana, Mantī, Bhoja, Suyāma and Sudatta.  In the Milinda (236), where the eight names are given, Kondañña appears as Yañña) sent for to prognosticate, and though he was yet quite a novice he declared definitely that the babe would be a Buddha.  Thereafter he lived awaiting the Bodhisatta's renunciation.  After this happened he left the world with four others, and the five later became known as the Pañcavaggiyā (J.i.65f.; AA.i.78-84; ThagA.ii.1ff).  When, after the Enlightenment, the Buddha visited them at Isipatana and preached the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, Kondañña and eighteen crores of brahmas won the Fruit of the First Path.  As he was the first among humans to realise the Dhamma the Buddha praised him saying "aññāsi vata bho Kondañño" twice; hence he came to be known as Aññata Kondañña.  (Vin.i.12; UdA.324, 371; Mtu.iii.333).  [/p][p]It is interesting to note that in the Burmese MSS.  the name appears as Aññāsi-Kondañña.  The Cy.  explains Aññāta-Kondañña by "pativedha Kondañña." In the ThagA.  he is called Añña-Kondañña.  Mrs.  Rhys Davids suggests that Aññā was his personal name (Gotama the Man, p.102).[/p][p]Five days later when the Anattalakhana Sutta was preached he became arahant (Vin.i.13-14).  He was the first to be ordained with the formula "ehi, bhikkhu" and the first to receive higher ordination.  Later, at Jetavana, amidst a large concourse of monks, the Buddha declared him to be the best of those who first comprehended the Dhamma (AA.i.84).  He was also declared to be pre-eminent among disciples of long-standing (rattaññūnam) (A.i.23).  [/p][p]In the assembly of monks he sat behind the two chief disciples.  Finding that his presence near the Buddha was becoming inconvenient to himself and others (For his reasons see AA.i.84; SA.i.216), he obtained the Buddha's permission to go and live on the banks of the Mandākini in the Chaddanta-vana, where he stayed for twelve years, only returning at the end of that period to obtain the Buddha's leave for his parinibbāna.  The elephants in the forest took it in turns to bring him his food and to look after him.  Having bidden farewell to the Buddha, he returned to Chaddanta-vana, where he passed away (SA.i.218; AA.i.84).  We are told (SA.i.219) that all Himavā wept at his death.  The obsequies were elaborately performed by eight thousand elephants with the deva Nāgadatta at their head.  All the devas from the lowest to the highest brahma world took part in the ceremony, each deva contributing a piece of sandalwood.  Five hundred monks, led by Anuruddha, were present.  The relics were taken to Veluvana and handed over to the Buddha, who with his own hand deposited them in a silver cetiya which appeared from the earth.  Buddhaghosa states that the cetiya existed even in his time (SA.i.219).[/p][p]Several verses attributed to Kondañña are given in the Theragāthā, admonishing fellow celibates to lead the higher life, because everything is impermanent, bound to ill and void of soul (Thag.674-88).[/p][p]On one occasion he preached to Sakka at the latter's own request; Sakka expressed himself as greatly pleased because the sermon was worthy even of the Buddha."[/p][p]Vangisa once extolled his virtues in the presence of the Buddha (Thag.v.673; ThagA.ii.3).[/p][p]In Padumuttara's time Kondañña had been a rich householder, and, seeing one of the monks given preference in seniority, he wished for a similar rank for himself in the future.  Towards this end he did many acts of piety, one of them being to build a golden chamber over the Buddha's relics.  In Vipassī's time was a householder, Mahākāla, and gave to the Buddha the first-fruits of his field in nine stages of their produce (ThagA.ii.1; DhA.i.80).[/p][p]According to the Apadāna (i.48f.; The Divy 430 mentions another previous birth of Kondañña), he offered the first meal to Padumuttara after his Enlightenment.[/p][p]Punna Mantānīputta was his nephew and was ordained by him.

We never hear of its having regained its former independence, and traditions of war between the two countries are mentioned (E.g., J.iv.454; J.v.316; J.vi.271).[/p][p]In the Buddha's time the Angarājā was just a wealthy nobleman, and he is mentioned merely as having granted a pension to a Brahmin (M.ii.163).  The people of Anga and Magadha are generally mentioned together, so we may gather that by the Buddha's time they had become one people.  They provide  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uruvela_kassapa,Uruvela-Kassapa')"]Uruvela-Kassapa[/a] with offerings for his great sacrifice (Vin.i.27).

On one occasion Sakka appears in person and goes with them to the Buddha so that they may not waste their energies in futile sacrifices (SA.i.269-70).[/p][p]Several discourses were preached in the Anga country, among them being the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sonadanda_sutta,Sonadanda Sutta')"]Sonadanda Sutta[/a] and the two Assapura Suttas ( [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_assapura_s,Mahā')"]Mahā[/a]- and Cūla-).

  <e>[div class="huge"]Avīci[/div][p]One of the eight great purgatories (mahāniraya) (J.v.266).  It is ten thousand leagues in extent and forms part of a cakkavāla (SnA.ii.443).[/p][p]The Milindapañha (p.5), however, places it outside the sphere of the earth.  Spence Hardy (Manual of Buddhism, p.26) mentions a tradition which says that Avīci is seven hundred miles directly under the Bodhi Tree at Gaya.  In later books, e.g.  the Dhammapada Commentary, it is represented as being under the earth, for we are told that the earth opened wide to allow the flames of Avīci to escape and to drag down sinners into its bowels (E.g., DhA.i.127, 147; iii.181).  It seems to have been specially designed for those who had committed very grievous crimes, among whom are [/p][ul][li][p]Devadatta; [/li][li][p]Cunda, the pork butcher; [/li][li][p]Ananda, who raped his cousin the Therī Uppalavannā; [/li][li][p]the ascetic Jambuka, who in a previous birth had insulted an arahant; [/li][li][p]the murderer of the Pacceka Buddha Sunetta; [/li][li][p]Sīvalī, who in a former birth had blockaded a city for seven years; [/li][li][p]Suppabuddha, who insulted the Buddha; [/li][li][p]Mallikkā, because of her misbehaviour with a dog (she was only there seven days); [/li][li][p]Ciñcā-Mānavikā, because she falsely accused the Buddha; [/li][li][p]and Kapila, brother of Sodhana, for reviling pious monks.  [/li][/ul][p]For details and references see under these names; see also Mil.357.[/p][p][/p][p]According to Buddhaghosa, Avīci is often called Mahā Niraya (AA.i.376).  Descriptions of it are to be found in several places in the four Nikāyas (E.g., M.iii.183; A.i.141-2).  It is a quadrangular space, one hundred leagues each way, four-doored, walled all round and above with steel and with floor of incandescent molten steel.[/p][p][/p][p]The Dhammapadatthakathā gives a description of the tortures that await the entrant to Avīci.  When, for instance, Devadatta entered there, his body became one hundred leagues in height, his head, as far as the outer ear, entered into an iron skull; his feet sank up to the ankles in iron, an iron stake as thick as the trunk of a palmyra tree came from the west wall, pierced the small of his back and, penetrating his breast, entered the east wall.  Other similar stakes came from the south and from the north and transfixed him (DhA.i.148).[/p][p][/p][p]The fire of Avīci is so powerful that it destroys the eyes of anyone looking at it from a distance of one hundred leagues (A.i.142).  It would destroy in a moment a rock as large as a gabled house, yet beings born there remain undestroyed, as though reposing in their mother's womb (DhA.i.127; Mil.67).[/p][p][/p][p]Beings born in Avīci suffer for periods of varying lengths; thus, Mallikā, Pasenadi's queen, remained only for seven days (DhA.iii.121), while Devadatta is destined to pass there 100,000 kappas (DhA.i.148).  [/p][p][/p][p]The Sutta Nipata (p.126) gives the names of various specified periods of suffering, which, according to Buddhaghosa (SnA.i.476), are to be spent in Avīci; they are Abbuda, Nirabbuda, Ababa, Ahaha, Atata, Kumuda, Sogandhika, Uppalaka, Pundarīka, and Paduma, taken in a geometrical progression of twenty (i.e.  twenty Abbudas=one Nirabbuda, etc.).[/p][p][/p][p]Another mode of suffering in Avīci is described as Sarājita (SA.iii.100).[/p][p]It is noteworthy that the word Avīci occurs only once in the four Nikāyas - namely, in a passage in the Cakkavatti-Sīhānāda Sutta of the Digha Nikāya (D.iii.75; repeated in A.i.159) - but in this context there is no indication that the name refers to a purgatory.  The word is not found in a list of purgatories given in the Sutta Nipāta (pp.126-31) and in the Samyutta (i.152).  It is, however, found in a poem in the Itivuttaka (No.  89) which recurs both in the Vinaya (ii.203) and in the Dhammasangani (Section 1280), and there it is specifically called a niraya.[/p][p][/p][p]In the Digha passage mentioned above, the reference to Avīci is in connection with a tremendous growth of population which will occur in Jambudīpa in a future age.  Houses will be so close that a cock could fly from any one to the next, and one would think it Avīci (avīci maññe).[/p][p][/p][p]Rhys Davids suggests (Dial.iii.73, n.1) that the word (which he translates as Waveless Deep) might have been originally used to denote density of population.  Buddhaghosa (DA.iii.855) explains it as "nirantara-pūrita" perhaps in the sense that it is filled with fire.  In the Visuddhi Magga (ii.449) the word appears to be a synonym for jars (disintegration) and is used in connection with the disintegration of earth, water, mountains, sun, moon, etc.[/p][p][/p][p]Avīci is often referred to as the lowest point of the universe (Thus, e.g.,Vsm.ii.390, 486; Mbv.57).  [/p][p]The chief suffering endured there is that of heat (MNidA., p.8).[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Asokārāma[/div][p]A monastery in Pātaliputta, built by Asoka and finished in three years.  It was there that the king's brother Tissa was ordained.  When the monks had refused for seven years to hold the uposatha ceremony, Asoka sent his minister to summon them to the Asokārāma.  There the misguided minister beheaded several theras who refused to obey his orders.  It was there that Moggaliputta Tissa held the Third Council and made a compilation of the Dhamma (Mhv.v.80, 163, 174, 236, 276).[/p][p]Asoka used to feed 60,000 monks daily at the Asokārāma.[/p][p][/p][p]On the day of the foundation of the Mahā Thūpa in Anurādhapura, sixty thousand monks under Mittinna came from Asokārāma (Mhv.xxix.36).

  <e>[div class="huge"]Anupiya (Anupiyā)[/div][p]A township in the Malla country to the east of Kapilavatthu.  In the mango grove there (the Anupiya-ambavana) the Buddha, having arrived from Anomā and having ordained himself, spent the first week after his renunciation, before going to Rājagaha, thirty leagues away (J.i.65-6).  He went there again after his return from Kapilavatthu, whither he had gone to see his relations, and large numbers of Sākiyan princes joined the Order, including Bhaddiya, Anuruddha, Ananda, Bhagu, Kimbila, Devadatta and their barber, Upāli (Vin.ii.180f.; AA.i.108; DhA.i.133; iv.127).[/p][p]It was during this stay that the Buddha preached the Sukhavihāri Jātaka (J.i.140).  From Anupiya the Buddha went to Kosambi (Vin.ii.184).  Near Anupiya was the pleasaunce where the paribbājaka of the Bhaggavagotta lived.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Asita Devala[/div][hr][p][b]1. Asita Devala.[/b]-A sage (isi).  His story is given in the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/assalaayana,Assalāyana Sutta')"]Assalāyana Sutta[/a] (M.ii.154ff).  Once there were seven brahmin sages living in thatched cabins in the wilds.  They conceived the view that the brahmins are the highest class of men and that they alone are the legitimate sons of Brahma.  Hearing of this, Asita Devala appeared before their hermitage in orange attire, with stout sandals and staff, and shouted for them.  The brahmins cursed him with the intention of shrivelling him into a cinder, but the more they cursed the more comely and handsome grew Asita.  Feeling that their austerities were evidently fruitless, they questioned Asita who urged them to discard their delusion.  Having learnt his identity, they saluted him and wished to be instructed; Asita examined and cross-questioned them about their pretensions regarding their lineage and they could find no answer.  They thereupon followed his advice and renounced their claims to superiority.[/p][p]Buddhaghosa says that Asita Devala was the Bodhisatta.  MA.ii.785.[/p][hr][p][b]2. Asita Devala.[/b]-More commonly called Kāla Devala, probably identical with (1) above, and mentioned in the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/indriya_jat_423,Indriya Jātaka')"]Indriya Jātaka[/a] (J.iii.463ff).

He had a younger brother Nārada, also an ascetic, who lived in Arañjara.  When Nārada became enamoured of a courtesan on the river-bank near Arañjara, Kāla Devala flew to him, and in due course brought Sālissara, Mendissara and Pabbatissara to admonish him.  When they, too, failed in their efforts to convert Nārada, Kāla Devala brought the master of all sages, Sarabhanga, who with their help persuaded Nārada to give up his love.[/p][p]In this present age Kāla Devala became Mahā Kaccana (J.iii.469).[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Assaji-Punabbasukā[/div][p]The followers of Assaji and Punabbasu.  They lived in Kītāgiri, between Sāvatthi and Ālavi, and were guilty of various evil practices.  They used to grow flowers, make wreaths and garlands, and send them to girls and women of respectable families and also to slave girls, to lie with such women, and disregard the precepts regarding the eating of food at the wrong time, using perfumes, visiting shows, singing and playing games of various sorts (they violated eighteen precepts, Sp.iii.625).  Their abandoned ways of life won popularity for them, and virtuous monks, who did not belong to their group, were not welcomed by the people of the neighbourhood.[/p][p][/p][p]The Buddha heard of their nefarious doings from a monk who had been sojourning in the district, and having convened a meeting of the Sangha, sent Sāriputta and Moggallāna, together with a number of other monks, (for the recalcitrant were passionate and violent), to carry out the Pabbājaniyakamma (Act of Banishment) against them.  The deputation of the Sangha went to Kītāgiri and made an order that the Assaji-Punabbasukā should no longer dwell there, but the latter, instead of obeying the injunction, abused the monks, accusing them of partiality, and not only departed from Kītāgiri, but also left the Order.  When the matter was reported to the Buddha he had the Pabbājaniyakamma revoked ("because it had served no purpose") (Vin.ii.9-13, 14, 15).[/p][p][/p][p]In the Dhammapada Commentary (ii.109) we are told that Assaji and Punabbasu had originally been disciples of Sāriputta and Moggallāna, and that when the two Aggasāvakas admonished them and their followers on the wickedness of their conduct, some of them reformed themselves and a few retired to the householder's life.[/p][p][/p][p]The Assaji-Punabbasukas seem to have had a special dislike for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.  Once the Buddha, on his way somewhere from Sāvatthi, accompanied by Sāriputta, Moggallāna and five hundred others, sent word to the Assaji-Punabbasukas to prepare sleeping places for them.  They sent answer that the Buddha was very welcome, but not Sāriputta and Moggallāna, because "they were men of sinful desires and influenced by such desires." (Vin.ii.171)[/p][p][/p][p]But elsewhere (Kītāgiri Sutta, M.i.473ff) even the Buddha is represented as having been lightly regarded by them.  When it was reported to them that the Buddha lived on only one meal a day and found that it made him well and healthy, their reply was that they themselves ate in the evening and the early morning and at noon and outside prescribed hours, and that they found this quite agreeable and saw no reason for changing their mode of life.  It is true, however, that even on this occasion when the Buddha sent for them, they came dutifully and listened patiently to his admonition on the necessity of implicit obedience to a teacher in whom they had faith, and we are told that they were "even gladdened in their hearts" after hearing the Buddha.  There is, however, no evidence that they reformed after hearing him.[/p][p][/p][p]In the Commentaries (E.g., DA.ii.525) the Assaji-Punabbasukā are mentioned as an example of those who paid no heed to precepts great or small, which they had undertaken to observe.[/p][p][/p][p]The Samantapāsādikā (iii.614) mentions that Kītāgiri was chosen by them as residence because it was watered by both monsoons, produced three crops, and had suitable sites for buildings.[/p][p]They were five hundred in number.[/p][hr]</e>

Hearing of this the nāga king came out and tried to frighten the Elder with various terrors.  When all his attempts had failed he acknowledged defeat and the thera preached to him.

Once when he was staying in a forest hut in the Mahāvana in Vesāli, near to where the Buddha was, certain wandering ascetics came to him and asked him whether or not a Tathāgata exists after death; dissatisfied with his answer they called him "fool" and went away.  Thereupon Anurādha sought advice from the Buddha, who asked him "How, inasmuch as it cannot be said of a Tathāgata even in this very life that he really exists, can anything be said regarding him after death?"[/p][p]S.iii.116-19; the same story is repeated, with slight expansions, in S.iv.380-6.[/p][p][/p][p]2.

Both the earlier children of the Queen Consort had been eaten up by a she-goblin.  For the third child, therefore, an iron house (Ayoghara) was built, and in this the Bodhisatta was born, hence his name, Ayoghara.  [/p][p]Meanwhile the she-goblin had died, but yet the Bodhisatta grew up in the iron house.  When he was sixteen his father, wishing to give him the kingdom, had him taken in ceremonial procession round the city.  Wondering at all that he saw, he asked why he had been denied the sight of all these things before.  When told the reason, he reflected that all life was a prison, that though he had escaped the goblin, there still remained old age and death.  Accordingly, at the end of the procession, he announced his intention of renouncing the world.  His parents and many others being converted to his views, they followed him into the forest, where a special hermitage was built for them by Vissakamma under Sakka's orders.  J.iv.490-99.[/p]</e>

[/p][p]Its capital was  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ujjenii,Ujjenī')"]Ujjenī[/a].  But according to another account (D.ii.235), Māhissati is mentioned as having been, at least for some time, the capital of Avanti.  It is quite likely that ancient Avanti was divided into two parts, the northern part having its capital at Ujjenī and the southern part (also called [b]Avanti Dakkhināpatha[/b]) at Māhissati (Māhismatī) (Bhandarkar: Carmichael Lectures (1918), p.54).  This theory is supported by the fact that in the Mahābhārata (ii.31, 10), Avanti and Māhismatī are referred to as two different countries.[/p][p]In the Buddha's time, the King of Avanti was Pajjota, a man of violent temper (Vin.i.277), and therefore known as  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cannda_ppajjota,Canda Pajjota')"]Canda Pajjota[/a].  He wished to conquer the neighbouring kingdom of Kosambī, of which Udena was king, but his plans did not work out as he had anticipated.  Instead, his daughter  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaasuladattaa,Vāsuladattā')"]Vāsuladattā[/a] became Udena's wife and the two countries continued to be on friendly terms.

Kaccāna returned to Avanti and converted Pajjota to the faith of the Buddha (ThagA.i.485).  Henceforward Mahā Kaccāna seems to have spent a good deal of his time in Avanti, dwelling in the city of Kuraraghara in the Papāta Pabbata (S.iii.9, 12; iv.115-16; A.v.46; also UdA.307).[/p][p]The religion thus introduced, however, does not seem to have spread to any extent until much later; for we find Mahā Kaccāna experiencing great difficulty in collecting ten monks, in order that Sona Kutikanna might receive the higher Ordination; in fact it was not until three years had elapsed that he succeeded (Vin.i.195).  Later, when Sona Kutikanna visited the Buddha at Sāvatthi, he conveyed to the Buddha Mahā Kaccāna's request that special rules might be laid down for the convenience of the monks of Avanti Dakkhināpatha and of, other border countries (Vin.i.197-8).  The Buddha agreed, and among the rules so laid down were the following: [/p][ul][li](1) The higher Ordination could be given with only four monks and a Vinayadhara.  [/li][li](2) Monks are allowed the use of shoes with thick linings (because in Avanti the soil is black on the surface, rough and trampled by cattle).  [/li][li](3) Monks are enjoined to bathe frequently (the men of Avanti attaching great importance to bathing).  [/li][li](4) Sheepskins, goatskins, etc., could be used as coverlets.  [/li][li](5) Robes could be accepted on behalf of a monk who has left the district, and the ten days' rule with regard to such a gift will not begin until the robes have actually reached the monk's hands (Cp.  the first nissaggiya rule, Vin.iii.195-6) (this, evidently, because of difficulty of access).[/li][/ul][p]By the time of the Vesāli Council, however, Avanti had become one of the important centres of the orthodox school, for we find  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yasa,Yasa Kākandakaputta')"]Yasa Kākandakaputta[/a] sending messengers to Avanti to call representatives to the Council, and we are told that eighty-eight arahants obeyed the summons (Vin.ii.298-9).[/p][p]Among other localities in Avanti (besides those mentioned above) were Ghanaselapabbata, Makkarakata and Velugāma, and, in Jaina works, we find mention also of Sudarsanapura (Law: Ksatriya Tribes, p.148).[/p][p]Even in the Buddha's day there were rumours of the King of Avanti making preparations to attack Magadha, but we are not told that he ever did so (E.g.,M.iii.7).  Subsequently, however, before the time of Candagupta, Avanti became incorporated with Magadha.  Before Asoka became King of Magadha he was the Magadha Viceroy of Avanti and ruled in Ujjeni, and it was in Ujjeni that Mahinda and Sanghamittā were born and grew up (Mhv.xiii.8ff).  But the country seems to have retained its name at least as late as the second century A.D., as may be seen from Rudradāman's Inscription at Junagadh (Buddhist India, p.28).[/p][p]Avanti is now identified with the country north of the Vindhaya Mountains and north-east of Bombay, roughly corresponding to modern Mālwa, Nimār and adjoining parts of the Central Provinces (Law: Geography of Early Buddhism, p.22).[/p][p]In the Milindapañha (Trs.ii.250, n.1) Avanti is mentioned as one of the three mandalas or great divisions of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jambudiipa,Jambudīpa')"]Jambudīpa[/a], the other two being Pācīna and Dakkhināpatha.[/p][p]According to a late tradition recorded in the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhavamsa,Buddhavamsa')"]Buddhavamsa[/a] (Bu.xxviii.10), the Buddha's mat (nisīdana) and rug were deposited, after his death, in Avanti.[/p][p]It has sometimes been suggested that Avanti was the home of modern Pāli (E.g.,in Bud.  India, pp.153-4).  It has further been suggested that the Avanti school of monks - founded by Mahā Kaccāna, who was considered the greatest analytical exponent of the Buddha's time - living in comparative isolation (as seen above) on account of difficulty of access (Avanti, however, lay on the road taken by  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bavari,Bāvari')"]Bāvari's[/a] ten disciples on their way from Patitthāna to Sāvatthi), and laying special stress on dhutavāda practices (Vin.ii.299) - developed branches of knowledge dealing mainly with grammar and doctrinal interpretation by ways of exegetical analysis.  The Pāli grammar ascribed to Kaccāyana and the Netti-ppakarana were both works of this school.  For a discussion of this see PLC.181ff [/p][p]Avanti was one of the parts into which the earth was divided by King Renu, with the help of his Great Steward, Mahā-Govinda.

Being pleased with him, the king wished to present him with a village of which the revenue was a thousand, but the ascetic declined the gift.  For twelve years the ascetic lived in the park; then, desiring a change, he went away, and in the course of his wanderings, arrived at a ferry on the Ganges, where lived a foolish ferryman named Avāriyapitā.  He took the Bodhisatta across, on the latter's promising to tell him how to increase his wealth, his welfare and his virtue.  On reaching the other side, the Bodhisatta advised the ferryman on the desirability of getting his fare before crossing if he wished to increase his wealth; he then proceeded to recite to him the stanzas on the virtue of compassion, which, for twelve years, he had daily recited to the king.  Incensed at feeling that he had been cheated out of his money, the ferryman started striking the ascetic; his wife, coming along with his food, tried to stop him.  Thereupon he struck her, upsetting the food and causing her womb to miscarry.  He was brought before the king and punished.[/p][p]Good advice is wasted on fools, like fine gold on beasts.[/p][p]The story was told regarding a foolish ferryman of Aciravatī.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Ariyavamsa[/div][hr][p][b]1. Ariyavamsa.[/b]-A compilation, probably of the life-histories of men eminent in the Buddhist Order, made in Ceylon and read aloud publicly for the edification of the people.  The reading of the Ariyavamsa seems once to have been a regular feature of gatherings in the Buddhist vihāras on feast days.  King Vohāraka-T1ssa made endowments for the giving of alms throughout Ceylon on the occasions when the Ariyavamsa was read (Mhv.xxxvi.38; Mhv.trans.258, n.6).  A sutta called [b]Ariyavamsa Sutta[/b] is mentioned in the Commentaries (DA.i.50; MA.i.14) as an example of a discourse preached by the Buddha on his own initiative (attajjhāsaya).  This perhaps refers to the sermon on the four Ariyavamsā in the Anguttara Nikāya (A.ii.27).

Ariyavamsa[/b].-A celebrated teacher and author of the fifteenth century.  He came from Pagan and was a member of the Chapata sect.  He was a pupil of the famous Ye-din ("water-carrier") of Sagaing (for an account of him see Bode, op.  cit., 41f), and with great zeal and enthusiasm learnt the Abhidhammattha-vibhāvanī from his teacher.  Later, Ariyavamsa wrote a commentary on this work and called it the Manisāramañjūsā.  A charming anecdote is related of how he read the work to his colleagues and readily accepted their corrections with gratitude.[/p][p]Among his other works are the Manidīpa, a Tīkā on the Atthasālinī, a grammatical treatise, the Gandhābharana, and a study of the Jātakas called the Jātakavisodhana.[/p][p]Ariyavamsa spent only a part of his life at Sagaing and afterwards taught at Ava, where the king was sometimes among his listeners.  He was among the first of Burmese litterateurs to write a metaphysical work in the vernacular - an Anutīkā on the Abhidhamma (Sās.  p.41ff).  The Gandha-Vamsa (64-5) attributes to him another work, the Mahānissara (Mahānissaya?), but no mention is made of it in the Sāsanavamsa.[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Anāthapindika[/div][p]A banker (setthi) of Sāvatthi who became famous because of his unparalleled generosity to the Buddha.  His first meeting with the Buddha was during the first year after the Enlightenment, in Rājagaha (the story is given in Vin.ii.154ff; SA.i.240ff, etc.), whither Anāthapindika had come on business.  [/p][p][/p][p]His wife was the sister of the setthi of Rājagaha, and when he arrived he found the setthi preparing a meal for the Buddha and his monks on so splendid a scale that he thought that a wedding was in progress or that the king had been invited.  On learning the truth he became eager to visit the Buddha, and did so very early the next morning (Vin.ii.155-6).  He was so excited by the thought of the visit that he got up three times during the night.  When, at last, he started for Sītavana, the road was quite dark, but a friendly Yakkha, Sīvaka, sped him on with words of encouragement.  By force of his piety the darkness vanished.[/p][p][/p][p]The Buddha was staying in the Sītavana, and when Anāthapindika reached there spirits opened the door for him.  He found the Buddha walking up and down, meditating in the cool air of the early dawn.  The Buddha greeted him and talked to him on various aspects of his teaching.  Anāthapindika was immediately converted and became a Sotāpanna.  He invited the Buddha to a meal the next day, providing everything himself, although the setthi, the Mayor of Rājagaha and King Bimbisāra asked to be allowed to help.  After the meal, which he served to the Buddha with his own hand, he invited the Buddha to spend the rainy season at Sāvatthi, and the Buddha accepted, saying "the Tathāgatas, o householder, take pleasure in solitude." "I understand, o Blessed One, I understand," was the reply.[/p][p][/p][p]When Anāthapindika had finished his business at Rājagaha he set out towards Sāvatthi, giving orders along the way to his friends and acquaintances to prepare dwellings, parks, rest-houses and gifts all along the road to Sāvatthi in preparation for the Buddha's visit.  He had many friends and acquaintances and he was ādeyyavaco (his word was held to be of weight), loc.  cit., p.158. But see J.i.92, where it is said that Anāthapindika bore all the expenses of these preparations.  Vihāras were built costing l,000 pieces each, a yojana apart from each other.[/p][p][/p][p]Understanding the request implied in the Buddha's words when he accepted the invitation, Anāthapindika looked out for a quiet spot near Sāvatthi where the Buddha and the monks might dwell, and his eye fell on the park of Jetakumāra.  He bought the park at great expense and erected therein the famous Jetavanārāma.  As a result of this and of his numerous other benefactions in the cause of the Sāsana, Anāthapindika came to be recognised as the chief of alms-givers (A.i.25).[/p][p][/p][p]Anāthapindika's personal name was Sudatta, but he was always called Anāthapindika (AA.i.208; MA.i.50) (feeder of the destitute) because of his munificence; he was, however, very pleased when the Buddha addressed him by his own name (Vin.ii.156).  He spent eighteen crores on the purchase of Jetavana and a like sum on the construction of the vihāra; another eighteen crores were spent in the festival of dedication.  He fed one hundred monks in his house daily in addition to meals provided for guests, people of the village, invalids, etc.  Five hundred seats were always ready in his house for any guests who might come (AA.i.208-9. He fed 1,000 monks daily says DhA.i.128; but see J.iii.119, where a monk, who had come from far away and had missed the meal hour, had to starve.).[/p][p][/p][p]Anāthapindika's father was the setthi Sumana (AA.  loc.  cit).  The name of Anāthapindika's brother was Subhūti.[/p][p][/p][p]Anāthapindika married a lady called Puññalakkhanā (J.ii.410; J.iii.435, she was the sister of the setthi of Rājagaha.  SA.i.240); he had a son Kāla and three daughters, Mahā-Subhaddā, Cūla-Subhaddā and Sumanā.  (Besides Kāla, Anāthapindika had another son, who joined the Order under Subhūti Thera; AA.ii.865).  Mention is also made of a daughter-in law, Sujātā by name, daughter of Dhanañjaya and the youngest sister of Visākhā.  She was very haughty and ill-treated the servants (J.ii.347).[/p][p][/p][p]The son, in spite of his father's efforts, showed no piety until he was finally bribed to go to the vihāra and listen to the Buddha's preaching (see Kāla).  The daughters, on the other hand, were most dutiful and helped their father in ministering to the monks.  The two elder ones attained to the First Fruit of the Path, married, and went to live with the families of their husbands.  Sumanā obtained the Second Fruit of the Path, but remained unmarried.  Overwhelmed with disappointment because of her failure in finding a husband, she refused to eat and died; she was reborn in Tusita (DhA.i.128f).[/p][p][/p][p]The Bhadraghata Jātaka (J.ii.431) tells us of a nephew of Anāthapindika who squandered his inheritance of forty crores.  His uncle gave him first one thousand and then another five hundred with which to trade.  This also he squandered.  Anāthapindika then gave him two garments.  On applying for further help the man was taken by the neck and pushed out of doors.  A little later he was found dead by a side wall.[/p][p][/p][p]The books also mention a girl, Punnā, who was a slave in Anāthapindika's household.  On one occasion when the Buddha was starting on one of his periodical tours from Jetavana, the king, Anāthapindika, and other eminent patrons failed to stop him; Punnā, however, succeeded, and in recognition of this service Anāthapindika adopted her as his daughter (MA.i.347-8).  On uposatha days his whole household kept the fast; on all occasions they kept the pañcasīla inviolate (J.iii.257).[/p][p][/p][p]A story is told of one of his labourers who had forgotten the day and gone to work; but remembering later, he insisted on keeping the fast and died of starvation.  He was reborn as a deva (MA.i.540-1).[/p][p][/p][p]Anāthapindika had a business village in Kāsi and the superintendent of the village had orders to feed any monks who came there (Vin.iv.162f).  One of his servants bore the inauspicious name of Kālakanni (curse); he and the banker had been playmates as children, and Kālakanni, having fallen on evil days, entered the banker's service.  The latter's friends protested against his having a man with so unfortunate a name in his household, but he refused to listen to them.  One day when Anāthapindika was away from home on business, burglars came to rob his house, but Kālakanni with great presence of mind drove them away (J.i.364f).[/p][p]A similar story is related of another friend of his who was also in his service (J.i.441).[/p][p][/p][p]All his servants, however, were not so intelligent.  A slave woman of his, seeing that a fly had settled on her mother, hit her with a pestle in order to drive it away, and killed her (J.i.248f).[/p][p][/p][p]A slave girl of his borrowed an ornament from his wife and went with her companions to the pleasure garden.  There she became friendly with a man who evidently desired to rob her of her ornaments.  On discovering his intentions, she pushed him into a well and killed him with a stone (J.iii.435).[/p][p][/p][p]The story of Anāthapindika's cowherd, Nanda, is given elsewhere.[/p][p][/p][p]All the banker's friends were not virtuous; one of them kept a tavern (J.i.251).  As a result of Anāthapindika's selfless generosity he was gradually reduced to poverty.  But he continued his gifts even when he had only bird-seed and sour gruel.  The devata who dwelt over his gate appeared before him one night and warned him of his approaching penury; it is said that every time the Buddha or his monks came to the house she had to leave her abode over the gate and that this was inconvenient to her and caused her to be jealous.  Anāthapindika paid no attention to her warnings and asked her to leave the house.  She left with her children, but could find no other lodging and sought counsel from various gods, including Sakka.  Sakka advised her to recover for Anāthapindika the eighteen crores that debtors owed him, another eighteen that lay in the bottom of the sea, and yet eighteen more lying unclaimed.  She did so and was readmitted (DhA.iii.10ff; J.i.227ff).[/p][p][/p][p]Anāthapindika went regularly to see the Buddha twice a day, sometimes with many friends (J.i.95ff.; he went three times says J.i.226), and always taking with him alms for the young novices.  But we are told that he never asked a question of the Buddha lest he should weary him.  He did not wish the Buddha to feel obliged to preach to him in return for his munificence (DhA.i.3).  But the Buddha of his own accord preached to him on various occasions; several such sermons are mentioned in the Anguttara Nikāya:[/p][ul][li][p]on the importance of having a well-guarded mind like a well-protected gable in a house (A.i.261f); [/li][li][p]on the benefits the recipient of food obtains (life, beauty, happiness, strength); [/li][li][p]on the four obligations that make up the pious householder's path of duty (gihisāmikiccāni - waiting on the Order with robes, food, lodgings, medical requirements.  Referred to also in S.v.387, where Anāthapindika expresses his satisfaction that he had never failed in these obligations); [/li][li][p]on the four conditions of success that are hard to win (wealth gotten by lawful means, good report, longevity, happy rebirth); [/li][li][p]on the four kinds of happiness which a householder should seek (ownership, wealth, debtless ness, blamelessness) (these various tetrads are given in A.ii.64ff).[/li][li][p]on the five kinds of enjoyment which result from wealth rightfully obtained (enjoyment - experienced by oneself and by one's friends and relations, security in times of need, ability to pay taxes and to spend on one's religion, the giving of alms to bring about a happy rebirth, A.iii.45-6); [/li][li][p]the five things which are very desirable but difficult to obtain (long life, beauty, happiness, glory, good condition of rebirths, A.iii.47-8); [/li][li][p]the five sinful acts that justify a man's being called wicked (hurting of life, etc.  A.iii.204); [/li][li][p]the inadvisability of being satisfied with providing requisites for monks without asking oneself if one also experiences the joy that is born of ease of mind (evidently a gentle warning to Anāthapindika, A.iii.206-7).[/li][/ul][p]The Buddha preached the Velāma Sutta to encourage Anāthapindika when he had been reduced to poverty and felt disappointed that he could no longer provide luxuries for the monks (A.iv.392ff).  On another occasion the Buddha tells Anāthapindika that the Sotāpanna is a happy man because he is free from various fears: fear of being born in hell, among beasts, in the realm of Peta or in some other unhappy state; he is assured of reaching Enlightenment (A.iv.405f, also S.v.387f).[/p][p][/p][p]Elsewhere the Buddha tells Anāthapindika that it is not every rich man who knows how to indulge in the pleasures of sense legitimately and profitably (A.v.177ff).[/p][p][/p][p]There is, however, at least one sutta preached as a result of a question put by Anāthapindika himself regarding gifts and those who are worthy to receive them (A.i.62-3); and we also find him consulting the Buddha regarding the marriage of his daughter, Cola Subhaddā (DhA.iii.466).[/p][p][/p][p]Anāthapindika died before the Buddha.  As he lay grievously ill he sent a special message to Sāriputta asking him to come (again, probably, because he did not want to trouble the Buddha).  Sāriputta went with Ananda and preached to him the Anāthapindikovāda Sutta (M.iii.258f.; see also S.v.380-7, which contain accounts of incidents connected with this visit).  His pains left him as he concentrated his mind on the virtuous life he had led and the many acts of piety he had done.  Later he fed the Elders with food from his own cooking-pot, but quite soon afterwards he died and was born in the Tusita heaven.  That same night he visited the Buddha at Jetavana and uttered a song of praise of Jetavana and of Sāriputta who lived there, admonishing others to follow the Buddha's teaching.  In heaven he will live as long as Visākhā and Sakka (DA.iii.740).  [/p][p][/p][p]Various incidents connected with Anāthapindika are to be found in the Jātakas.  On one occasion his services were requisitioned to hold an inquiry on a bhikkhuni who had become pregnant (J.i.148).[/p][p][/p][p]Once when the Buddha went on tour from Jetavana, Anāthapindika was perturbed because there was no one left for him to worship; at the Buddha's suggestion, an offshoot from the Bodhi tree at Gaya was planted at the entrance to Jetavana (J.iv.229).[/p][p]Once a brahmin, hearing of Anāthapindika's luck, comes to him in order to find out where this luck lay so that he may obtain it.  The brahmin discovers that it lay in the comb of a white cock belonging to Anāthapindika; he asks for the cock and it is given to him, but the luck flies away elsewhere, settling first in a pillow, then in a jewel, a club, and, finally, in the head of Anāthapindika's wife.  The brahmin's desire is thus frustrated (J.ii.410f).[/p][p][/p][p]On two occasions he was waylaid by rogues.  Once they tried to make him drink drugged toddy.  He was at first shocked by their impertinence, but, later, wishing to reform them, frightened them away (J.i.268).[/p][p][/p][p]On the other occasion, the robbers lay in wait for him as he returned from one of his villages; by hurrying back he escaped them (J.ii.413).  Whenever Anāthapindika visited the Buddha, he was in the habit of relating to the Buddha various things which had come under his notice, and the Buddha would relate to him stories from the past containing similar incidents.  Among the Jātakas so preached are: Apannaka, Khadirahgāra, Rohinī, Vārunī, Punnapāti, Kālakanni, Akataññū, Verī, Kusanāli, Siri, Bhadraghata, Visayha, Hiri, Sirikālakannī and Sulasā.  [/p][p][/p][p]Anāthapindika was not only a shrewd business man but also a keen debater.  The Anguttara Nikāya (A.v.185-9) records a visit he paid to the Paribbājakas when he could think of nothing better to do.  A lively debate ensues regarding their views and the views of the Buddha as expounded by Anāthapindika.  The latter silences his opponents.  When the incident is reported to the Buddha, he speaks in high praise of Anāthapindika and expresses his admiration of the way in which he handled the discussion.[/p][p][/p][p]During the time of Padumattara Buddha Anāthapindika had been a householder of Hamsavatī.  One day he heard the Buddha speak of a lay-disciple of his as being the chief of alms-givers.  The householder resolved to be so designated himself in some future life and did many good deeds to that end.  His wish was fulfilled in this present life.  Anāthapindika is sometimes referred to as Mahā Anāthapindika to distinguish him from Cūla Anāthapindika.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Asurinda (Asurindaka) Sutta[/div][p]Recounts an interview between the Buddha and Asurinda Bhāradvāja in Veluvana.  When Asurinda heard that Bhāradvāja (probably the chief of the clan) had entered the Order, he was greatly vexed, and going up to the Buddha he abused him.  The Buddha remaining silent, Asurinda thought that he acknowledged defeat.  But the Buddha enlightened him, saying that the worse of the two is he who, when reviled, reviles back; he who does not so revile wins a twofold victory: he seeks the good both of himself and of the other (S.i.163f.; SA.i.178).[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Anurādhapura[/div][p][/p][p]The capital of Ceylon for nearly fifteen centuries.  It was built on the site of settlements started by the two Anurādhas on the bank of the Kadamba river, and was founded under the constellation Anurādha, hence the name.  MT.293; Mhv.x.76; this tradition seems to have been forgotten later, for in the Mbv.  (116) there is a suggestion that the city was so called because it was the dwelling of satisfied people (anurodhijana); or is this mere alliteration?[/p][p][/p][p]Pandukābhaya (394-307 B.C.) was the founder of the city, to which he removed the capital from Upatissagāma (Mhv.x.75-7), and there it remained up to the time of Aggabodhi IV.  (A.D.  626-41).  After a short period it became once more the capital, and continued to be so until the royal residence was removed elsewhere (see Cv.xlvi.34, where the new capital, Pulatthinagara, is first mentioned as a royal residence).  It was finally deserted in the eleventh century.[/p][p][/p][p]Pandukābhaya beautified the city with the artificial lakes Jayavāpi and Abhayavāpi.  It was round the last-named lake that the king laid out the city, including four suburbs, a cemetery, special villages for huntsmen and scavengers, temples to various pagan deities and residences for the engineer and other officials.  Abodes were also provided for devotees of various sects, such as the Jainas, the Ajīvakas, wandering monks and brahmins.  There were also hospitals and lying-in homes.  Guardians of the city (Nagaraguttikā) were appointed, one for the day and another for the night.  For a full description see Mhv.x.80-102.[/p][p]Pandukābhaya's son and successor, Mutasiva, laid out the beautiful Mahāmegha Park with fruit and flowering trees (Mhv.xi.2); this was to the south of the city; between it and the southern wall of the city was another park called Nandana or Jotivana (Mhv.xv.2, 11).[/p][p][/p][p]In the reign of Piyatissa, who succeeded Mutasiva (when Buddhism had been introduced into the land), the king, together with his nobles and people, erected many noble edifices in support of the new religion.  Ten of the most noted were in Anurādhapura (for list see Mhv.xx.17ff), and the Mahāmeghavana, which was given over to the Buddhist Sangha, henceforth became the centre of Buddhism in the island.  In this park was also planted, by Piyatissa, the branch of the Sacred Bodhi Tree which came from Gayā (for details see Mhv.xviii.  and xix).[/p][p][/p][p]Soon afterwards the city was taken by the Tamils but was recaptured by Dutthagāmani (101-77 B.C.), the hero of the Mahāvamsa.  Many chapters of the chronicle are devoted to descriptions of the numerous buildings erected by him in Anurādhapura for the glorification of the national faith (Mhv.  xxvi.-xxxvi), chief among them being the Maricavatti-vihāra, the Lohapāsāda and the Mahā Thūpa.[/p][p][/p][p]A few years later the Tamils once more overcame the city and held it till Vattagāmani (29-17 B.C.) drove them off.  In his reign was built the mighty Abhayagiri Thūpa and the vihāra attached to it (Mhv.xxxiii.80-3).[/p][p]The subsequent history of the city is a record of how succeeding kings repaired, added to, or beautified, these various monuments and the steps they took for their preservation.  The only later monument of real importance is the Jetavanārāma built by King Mahāsena (Mhv.xxxvii.33f ) (A.D.  334-61).[/p][p][/p][p]About this time the fame of Anurādhapura as the chief centre of Buddhist culture attracted many visitors from abroad in search of learning.  The most famous of these was the great commentator Buddhaghosa (Mhv.xxxvii.215ff.; also Fa Hien).  It was also during this period that Dhātusena (A.D.  460-78) reorganised the water supply of the city and built the Kālavāpi (Mhv.xxxviii.42).[/p][p]From this time onward the country suffered from a series of dynastic intrigues and civil wars, each party appealing to the Tamils of South India for help and protection.  As a result, the district round Anurādhapura was overrun by Tamil freebooters and became impossible to defend; the seat of government was therefore removed to Pulatthipura about the beginning of the ninth century, where it continued, except for a brief interval to the eleventh century.  Finally, about A.D.  1300, at a date not exactly known, the whole district was abandoned, having become a kind of no-man's land; it then rapidly relapsed into jungle.  For quite a long time, however, and even after Pulatthipura became the state capital, Anurādhapura was regarded as a centre of religious activity, and its monuments were restored from time to time (Mhv.lxxvi.106-20; lxxviii.96f.; xxxxviii.80f.[/p][p][/p][p]Various scraps of information regarding Anurādhapura and its inhabitants are found scattered in the commentaries.  E.g., that it had two indakhīlas (Sp.iii.299); its main street ran from Thūpārāma, where the chief entrance to the city lay (UdA.238; DA.ii.573).[/p][p]It was famous throughout Jambudīpa for its virtuous monks, and men came from there to visit them.  E.g., the brahmin who came from Pātaliputta to see Mahānāga Thera (AA.i.384).[/p][p][/p][p]The city wall, which existed at the time the Mahāvamsa was written, had been built by King Vasabha (Mhv.xxxv.97), and was, according to the Tīkā (p.  654), eighteen cubits in height.[/p]</e>

[/li][/ul][p]Rebirth as an Asura is considered as one of the four unhappy rebirths or evil states (apāyā), the others being niraya, tiracchānayoni and pettivisaya (E.g., It.93; J.vi.595; J.v.186; Pv.iv.11).[/p][p][/p][p]The fight between the Devas and the Asuras is mentioned even in the oldest books of the Tipitaka and is described in identical words in several passages (E.g., D.ii.285; S.i.222; iv.201ff; v.447; M.i.253; A.iv.432; also S.i.216ff).  [/p][p][/p][p]A chief or king of the Asuras is often referred to as Asurinda (*), several Asuras being credited with the role of leader, most commonly, however, Vepacitti (E.g., S.i.222; iv.201ff; J.i.205) and Rahu (A.ii.17, 53; iii.243).  [/p][blockquote][p](*)  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka,Sakka')"]Sakka[/a] was also called Asurinda and Asurādhipa; see, e.g., J.i.66 (Asurindena pavitthadevanagaram viya) and J.v.245, where we are told that from the time he conquered the Asuras he was called Asurādhipa.[/p][/blockquote][p]Besides these we find Pahārāda (A.iv.197, 200) (v.l.  Mahābhadda), Sambara (S.i.227), Verocana (S.i.225; probably another name for Rāhu, see DA.ii.689), Bali (D.ii.259), Sucitti (D.ii.269) and Namucī (D.ii.269).[/p][p][/p][p]The Asuras are spoken of as dwelling in the ocean after having been conquered by Vajira-hattha (Indra, elsewhere, [J.v.139] called Asurappamaddana) and are called Vāsava's brethren, of wondrous powers and of great glory.  They were present at the preaching of the Mahā Samaya Sutta (see DA.ii.689).  Buddhaghosa says that they were all descendants of an Asura maiden named Sujātā.  This cannot be the Sujātā, Vepacitti's daughter, whom Sakka married (J.i.205-6).  See also Dānavā.[/p][p][/p][p]There were evidently several classes of Asuras, and two are mentioned in the Pitakas, the Kālakañjakas and the Dānaveghasas.  The Dānaveghasas carried bows in their hands.  The Kālakañjakas were of fearsome shape (D.ii.259), and were considered the lowest among the Asuras (D.iii.7; see also Kālañkajaka and Vepacitti).[/p][p][/p][p]Once the Asuras dwelt in Tāvatimsa together with the devas.  When Magha Mānavaka was born as Sakka, he did not relish the idea of sharing a kingdom with others, and having made the Asuras drunken, he had them hurled by their feet on to the steeps of Sineru.  There they tumbled into what came to be known as the Asurabhanava, on the lowest level of Sineru, equal in extent to Tāvatimsa.  Here grew the Cittapātalī tree, and when it blossomed the Asuras knew they were no longer in the deva-world.  [/p][p][/p][p]Wishing to regain their kingdom, they climbed Sineru, "like ants going up a pillar." When the alarm was given, Sakka went out to give battle to them in the ocean, but being worsted in the fight, he fled in his Vejayantaratha.  Fearing that his chariot hurt the young Garulas, he had it turned back.  The Asuras, thinking that Sakka had obtained reinforcements, turned and fled right into the Asurabhavana.  Sakka went back to his city and in that moment of victory, the Vejayantapāsāda sprang up from the ground.  To prevent the Asuras from coming back again, Sakka set up as guard in five places Nāgas, Garulas, Kumbhandas, Yakkhas and the Four Great Kings.  Everywhere were images of Indra bearing the thunderbolt in his hand.  (J.i.202-4; DhA.i.272-80; the same story, differing slightly in details, is found in SnA.484-5).  There it is said that when Sakka was born among them, the Asuras received him with great cordiality; see also the various incidents of the Asura war mentioned in the Samyutta Nikāya I.  216ff.[/p][p][/p][p]The Asuras are sometimes called Pubbadevā (SnA.484) and their kingdom is 10,000 leagues in extent.  SnA.485; elsewhere, in the same page, it is given as 100,000 leagues.[/p][p][/p][p]In Buddhaghosa's time, the bygone lustre of the word Asura (as equivalent to Ahura) seems to have faded.  His explanation (SA.i.260) of the name is interesting.  When Sakka was born with his followers in the Asura-world (which later became Tāvatimsa) the Asuras prepared a drink called gandapāna.  Sakka warned his companions not to drink it, but the Asuras became drunk and were thrown down Sineru.  Halfway down they regained consciousness and made a vow never to drink intoxicants (surd) again; hence their name Asura.[/p][p][/p][p]The Anguttara Commentary (ii.526) defines Asura as bībhaccha, awful, vile.  They had a drum called Ālambara (q.v.), made of a crab's claw.  They left it behind in their flight from Sakka, and since then Sakka has the use of it (J.ii.344).[/p][p][/p][p]A story is told by the Buddha (S.2, v.446) of a man who once saw a whole army with its four divisions enter a lotus stalk and the man thought he was mad.  But the Buddha says that it was an Asura army in flight.  Here the Asuras would seem to be fairies or nature spirits.[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Apadāna[/div][p]The thirteenth division of the Khuddaka Nikāya.  It is a Buddhist Vitae Sanctorum and contains 547 biographies of monks and forty biographies of nuns, all mentioned as having lived in the time of the Buddha.  The Cy.  gives details of eleven more theras not found in the text: Yasa, Nadīkassapa, Gayākassapa, Kimbila, Vajjiputta, Uttara, Apara-Uttara, Bhaddaji, Sivika, Upavāna and Ralthapāla.  [/p][p][/p][p]In addition to these, there are two introductory chapters, the Buddhā-padāna and the Paccekabuddhā-padāna, dealing with the Buddha and the Pacceka Buddhas respectively.  It is worth noting that the Buddhā-padāna contains no account of the Buddha's life, either as Gotama or earlier, as Bodhisatta (see, however, Pubbakammapiloti).  Nor does the Paccekabuddhā-padāna contain any life-histories.  The stanzas are what might be more appropriately described as udāna, and appear in the Khaggavisāna Sutta of the Sutta Nipāta.  Cp.  the Mahāpadāna Sutta (D.ii.1ff), where the word Apadāna is used as meaning the legend or life-story of a Buddha or a Great One - in this case the seven Buddhas.  Or does Mahāpadāna mean the Great Story, i.e.  the story of the Dhamma and its bearers and promulgation: cp.  the title of the Mahāvastu (Dial.ii.3).[/p][p][/p][p]Most of the stories are found in the Paramatthadīpanī, the Commentary to the Thera- and Therīgāthā, extracted from the Apadāna with the introductory words, "tena vuttam Apadāne." But in numerous instances the names under which the verses appear in the Paramatthadīpanī differ from those subjoined to the verses in the Apadāna.  In several cases it is a matter of the Commentary giving a name while the Apadāna gives only a title.  E.g., Usabha Thera (ThagA.i.320), called Kosumbaphaliya (Ap.ii.449); and Isidinna (ThagA.i.312), called (Ap.ii.415) Sumanavījaniya.  [/p][p][/p][p]Sometimes the stories are duplicated in the Apadāna itself, the same story occurring in two places with a very slight alteration in words, even the name of the person spoken of being the same.  Most often no reason can be assigned for this, except, perhaps, careless editing.  E.g., Annasamsāvaka i Ap.i.78 and again i.261; see also the Introduction to the P.T.S.  Edition.[/p][p]The Apadāna is regarded as one of the very latest books in the Canon, one reason for this view being that while later books like the Buddhavamsa mention only twenty-four Buddhas previous to Gotama, the Apadāna contains the names of thirty-five.  It is very probable that the different legends in the collection are of different dates.  On these and other matters connected with the Apadāna, see Rhys Davids article in ERE.  and Muller's Les Apadānas du Sud (Congress of Orientalists, Leyden, 1895).[/p][p][/p][p]According to the Sumangala Vilāsinī (i.15. See also Przyluski: La Legende de l'Empereur Acoka, pp.  viii f., 214), the Dīghabhānakas, who included the Khuddaka Nikāya in the Abhidhammapitaka, did not recognise the Apadāna.  The Majjhimabhānakas included it in the Khuddaka Nikāya, which they regarded as belonging to the Suttapitaka.  There is a Commentary to the Apadāna called the Visuddhajanavilāsinī.[/p][p][/p][p]According to Gv.  (p.  69) the Commentary on the Apadāna was written by Buddhaghosa at the request of five monks.[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Asātamanta Jātaka (No.  61)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta was once a famous teacher in Takkasīlā.  A young brahmin of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"]Benares[/a] came to study under him and, after completing his course, went back home.  His mother, however, was anxious that he should renounce the world and tend Aggibhagavā in the forest.  She accordingly sent him back to the Teacher that he might learn the "Asātamanta" (Dolour Text).  The Teacher had a mother aged 120 years, on whom he himself waited.  When the youth came back to learn the Asātamanta, he was asked to look after the old woman.  She, falling in love with him, hatched a plot to kill her son.  [/p][p]The Bodhisatta, having been told of this plot, made a wooden figure and placed it in his bed.  The mother, thinking to kill her son, struck it with an axe, and discovering that she had been betrayed, fell down dead.  The youth, having thus learnt the Asātamanta, returned to his parents and became a hermit.

[/p][p]The chief Pāli sources of information regarding Asoka are Dīpavamsa (chaps.  i., v., vi., vii., xi., etc.), Mahāvamsa (v., xi., xx., etc.), Samantapāsādikā (pp.  [st2:frenchfranctoeuro ProductID="35 ff"]35 ff[/st2:frenchfranctoeuro].  ).  Other sources are the Divyāvadāna passim, and the Avadānasataka ii.200ff.  For an exhaustive discussion of the sources and their contents see Prszlyski, La Legende de l'Empereur Asoka.[/p][p]The Pāli Chronicles (Dīpavamsa and Mahāvamsa) mention only three of the sons, viz.  Sumana (Susīma according to the northern legends) the eldest, Asoka, and Tissa (uterine brother of Asoka) the youngest.  The Mahāvamsa Tīka (p.125; Mbv.98. In the northern tradition, e.g., Asokāvadānamālā, she is called Subhadrāngī, daughter of a brahmin of Campā) gives the name of his mother as Dhammā and calls her Aggamahesī (Bindusāra's chief queen); she belonged to the Moriyavamsa.  The preceptor of Dhammā's family was an Ājīvaka called Janasāna (which probably explains Asoka's earlier patronage of the Ājīvakas).[/p][p]In his youth Asoka was appointed Governor of Avanti with his capital at Ujjeni.  The Divy.  says he was in Takkasilā with headquarters in Uttarāpatha, where he superseded Susīma and quelled a rebellion.  When Bindusāra lay on his death-bed, Asoka left Ujjeni and came to Pātalīputta where he made himself master of the city and possessor of the throne.  He is stated in the Mahāvamsa (v.20; Mbv.98) to have killed all his brothers except Tissa that he might accomplish his purpose, and to have been called Candāsoka on account of this outrage (Mhv.v.189).  It is impossible to say how much truth there is in this account of the accession.  Asoka's Rock Edicts seem to indicate that he had numerous brothers, sisters and relations alive at the time they were written in Pātaliputta and other towns (see Mookherji, Asoka, pp.  3-6).  His brother Tissa he appointed as his uparāja (Mhv.v.33), but Tissa (q.v.) became a religious devotee attaining arahantship.  The Theragāthā Commentary refers to another younger brother of Asoka, Vitasoka, who also became an arahant (i.295f.  The northern works give quite a different account of his brothers.  See Mookherji, p.6).[/p][p]Asoka had several wives.  His first wife was the daughter of a merchant of Vedisagiri, whom he met when stopping at the merchant's house on his way to Ujjeni (Mhv.xiii.8ff).  Her name was Devī, also called Vedisa-Mahādevī, and she was a Sākyan, descended from a Sākyan family who migrated to Vedisa to escape from Vidūdabha (Mbv., pp.98, 116).  Of Devī were born a son Mahinda, and a daughter Sanghamittā, who became the wife of Aggibrahmā and mother of Sumana.  Devī evidently did not follow Asoka to Pātaliputta, for his aggamahesī there was Asandhamittā (Mhv.v.85).  Asandhamittā died in the thirtieth year of Asoka's reign, and four years later he raised Tissarakkhā to the rank of queen.  Mhv.xx.1-3. The Allahabad Pillar Inscription mentions another queen, Kāruvākī, mother of Tivara.  The Divy.  (chap.  xxvii.) gives another, Padmāvatī, Kunāla's mother.  Besides the children mentioned above, names of others are given: Jalauka, Cārumatī (Mookherji.  p.9).[/p][p]According to Mahāvamsa (v.21, 22), Asoka's accession was 218 years after the Buddha's death and his coronation was four years later.  The chronicles (v.22ff) contain various stories of his miraculous powers.  His command spread a yojana into the air and a yojana under the earth.  The devas supplied him daily with water from the Anotatta Lake and with other luxuries from elsewhere.  Yakkhas, Nāgas and even mice and karavīka birds ministered to his comfort, and thoughtful animals came and died outside his kitchen in order to provide him with food.[/p][p]At first Asoka maintained the alms instituted by his father, but soon, being disappointed in the recipients, he began looking out for holy men.  It was then that he saw from his window, his nephew, the young novice Nigrodha.  Owing to their friendship in a past birth (Asoka, Devanampiyatissa and Nigrodha had been brothers, traders in honey, and they gave honey to a Pacceka Buddha.  Asandhamittā had been the maiden who showed the honey-shop to the Pacceka Buddha.  The story is given in Mhv.v.49ff), Asoka was at once drawn to him and invited him into the palace.  Nigrodha preached to him the Appamādavagga and the king was greatly pleased.  He ceased his benefactions to other religious orders and transferred his patronage to Nigrodha and members of the Buddhist Order.  His wealth, which, according to the Samantapāsādikā (i.52), amounted to 500,000 pieces daily, he now spent in doing acts of piety - giving 100,000 to Nigrodha to be used in any manner he wished, a like sum for the offering of perfumes and flowers at the Buddha's shrines, 100,000 for the preaching of the Dhamma, 100,000 for the provision of comforts for members of the Order, and the remainder for medicines for the sick.  To Nigrodha, in addition to other gifts, he sent sets of robes three times each day, placing them on the back of an elephant, adorned by festoons of flowers.  Nigrodha gave these robes to other monks (MA.ii.931).[/p][p]Having learnt from Moggaliputta-Tissa that there were 84,000 sections of the Dhamma, he built in various towns an equal number of vihāras, and in Pātaliputta he erected the Asokārāma.  With the aid of the Nāga king Mahākāla, he created a life-size figure of the Buddha, to which he made great offerings.[/p][p]His two children, Mahinda and Sanghamittā, aged respectively twenty and eighteen, he ordained under Moggaliputta-Tissa and Dhammapālā, in the sixth year of his reign (MA.v.197, 209).  This raised him from a paccadāyaka to a sāsanadāyādin.[/p][p]In order to purge the Order of undesirable monks and heretical doctrines, Moggaliputta-Tissa held the Third Council under the king's patronage.  It is said that the pious monks refused to hold the uposatha with those they considered unworthy.  The king, desirous of bringing about unity in the Sangha, sent a minister to restore amity, but the minister, misunderstanding his orders, beheaded many holy monks, being at last stopped by the king's brother Tissa, who was then a monk (MA.vs.240ff).[/p][p]At the conclusion of the Council, held in the seventeenth year of his reign (Ibid., 280; in the northern texts Moggaliputta-Tissa's name is given as Upagupta.  It was for this Council that the Kathāvatthu was written), Asoka sent forth theras to propagate the Buddha's religion: Majjhantika to Kasmīra and Gandhāra, Mahādeva to Mahisamandala, Rakkhita to Vanavāsa, Yona Dhammarakkhita to Aparantaka, Mahārakkhita to Yona, Majjhima to the Himālaya country and Sona and Uttara to Suvannabhūmi; Mahinda with Itthiya, Uttiya, Sambala and Bhaddasāla he sent to Lankā (Ibid., xii.1-8. For particulars of these missions and identification of the places mentioned, see under the different names; this list appears also in the Samantapāsādikā, where further interesting details are given.  For a discussion on them see Mookherji, pp.33ff).  In the eighteenth year of his reign he sent to Lankā, at Devanampiyatissa's request, Sanghamittā, with a branch of the great Bodhi Tree at Buddhagayā (Mhv.xx.1).  A little earlier he had sent by his grandson Sumana, some relics of the Buddha and the Buddha's alms-bowl to be deposited in the thūpas of Lankā (Mhv.xvii.10f).[/p][p]Asoka reigned for thirty-seven years (Mhv.xx.6).  In his later life he came to be called Dhammāsoka on account of his pious deeds (Mhv.v.189).  The Dīpavamsa gives his name in several places as Piyadassī.  E.g., vi.1, 2, 25. The title Devānampiya used by Asoka in his inscriptions was also used by Tissa, Asoka's contemporary in Ceylon, and by Asoka's grandson Dasaratha (Nāgarjunī Hill Cave Inscription).  It was used also by other kings in Ceylon: Vankanāsika Tissa, Gajabāhukagāminī and Mahallaka-Nāga (Ep.  Zeyl.  i.60.f).[/p][p]The Chronicles state that Asoka and  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devaanampiyatissa,Devanampiya Tissa')"]Devanampiya Tissa[/a] of Ceylon had been friends - though they had never seen each other - even before Mahinda's mission to Ceylon.  Tissa had sent him, as a friendly gesture, various gifts, and Asoka had returned the courtesy.  He sent an embassy of his chosen ministers, bearing gifts marvellous in splendour, that Tissa might go through a second coronation ceremony, and the messengers were directed to give this special message to the king: "I have taken refuge in the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha and declared myself a follower of the religion of the Sākyaputta.  Seek then, even thou, oh best of men, converting thy mind with believing heart, refuge in these best of gems." (Mhv.xi.18-36)[/p][p]The Milindapanha (p.121) mentions an encounter of Asoka with a courtesan of Pātaliputta, Bindumatī, who, in order to show the king the power of an Act of Truth, made the waters of the Ganges to flow back.  According to the Petavatthu Atthakathā (244ff) there was a king of Surattha, called Pingala, who used to visit Asoka in order to give him counsel.

See  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/ankura,Ankura')"]Ankura[/a].[/p][p]In course of time the brothers had many sons and daughters, the average human age at that time being 20,000 years.  Later their sons annoyed the sage Kanhadīpāyana by dressing up a lad as a woman and asking him what child she would bring forth.  "A knot of acacia wood," he answered, "with which will be destroyed the line of Vasudeva."[/p][p]They laughed at the sage and kicked him.  On the seventh day the lad voided from his belly a knot of acacia wood which they burnt, casting the ashes into the river.  From those ashes, which stuck near the citygate, an Eraka-plant sprang up.  One day, while disporting themselves in the water, the kings, with their families and followers, started a sham quarrel and plucked leaves from the Eraka-plant to use as clubs.  The leaves turned into weapons in their hands, and they were all killed except Vāsudeva, Baladeva, Añjanadevī, and their chaplain, all of whom fled in a chariot.  Thus were the words of the sage fulfilled.[/p][p]In their flight they reached the Kālamattiya forest in which Mutthika had been born as a Yakkha.  When Mutthika saw Baladeva he assumed the shape of a wrestler and challenged him to a fight.  Baladeva accepted the challenge and "was gobbled up like a radish-bulb."[/p][p]Vāsudeva proceeded on his way with the others and at night lay in a bush for shelter.  A huntsman, mistaking him for a pig, speared him; when Vāsudeva heard that the huntsman's name was Jarā (Old Age) he reconciled himself to death.  Thus they all perished except Añjanadevī (J.iv.79ff), of whose later history nothing is mentioned.[/p][p]In the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kumbha_jat_512,Kumbha Jātaka')"]Kumbha Jātaka[/a] (J.v.  p.18) it is suggested that the Andhakavenhus were destroyed as a result of indulging in drink.

His queen consort  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ubbarii,Ubbarī')"]Ubbarī[/a] was very dear to him, and when she died he was plunged into grief.  He put her corpse in a coffin, placed it under his bed and lay thereon, starving for seven days.  The Bodhisatta was then an ascetic in the Himālaya, and just at this time he visited Potali.  There, in the royal park, the king came to see him because he was told that the ascetic would show him Ubbarī.  The Bodhisatta showed him Ubbarī now reborn as a dung-worm in the park, because, being intoxicated with her own beauty, she had done no good deeds.  Seeing the king incredulous, the ascetic made her speak, and she declared that she cared much more for the dung-worm, who was now her mate, than for Assaka who had been her husband in her previous life.

It does not, however; occur in the list of twelve countries given in the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/janavasabha,Janavasabha Sutta')"]Janavasabha Sutta[/a].  The Assakas are said to have had settlements on the Godāvarī, and Bāvarī's hermitage (Sn.v.977) was in their territory, in close proximity to the Alaka or Mulaka (the district round Paithan) (Law, Early Geography, 21).[/p][p]The country is mentioned with Avanti (J.v.317) in the same way as Anga with Magadha, and its position in the list between Sūrasena and Avanti makes it probable that when the list was drawn up, its position was immediately to the north-west of Avanti.  It is probable, in that case, that the Godāvarī settlement, in the Dakkhināpatha, was a later colony.[/p][p]In the Assaka Jātaka (J.ii.155) mention is made of a king Assaka whose realm was in the kingdom of Kāsī.  It is significant, in this connection, that the capital of Assaka, variously called Potana (E.g., D.ii.235; J.iii.3) or Potali (E.g., J.ii.155), is not mentioned in the reference to the Godāvarī.[/p][p]According to the Culla Kālinga Jātaka (J.iii.3-5), at one time the King of Assaka (Arum) accepted the challenge of King Kālinga of Dantapura to war, and defeated him.  Later Assaka married Kālinga's daughter and the relations between the two countries were amicable.  In the Hāthigumphā Inscription of Khāravela it is related that Khāravela, regardless of King Sātakarnī, sent a large army to the west (pachime disam) to strike terror into Assaka (or Asika) nagara.  Law (Op.cit., p.21) thinks that the Assaka of the Culla Kālinga Jātaka, the Asikanagara of the Hāthigumphā Inscription and the Assaka of the Sutta Nipāta are one and the same place.  This would probably be correct if Potana and Potali were regarded as two different cities, capitals of two different settlements having the same name.[/p][p]Sanskrit authors speak of both Asmakā and Asvakā.  It is not possible to say whether these represent two distinct tribes or whether they are variant names for the same people.  Asanga mentions Asmaka in his Sūtrālankāra as a territory on the basin of the Indus.  This would make it identical with the Assakenus of Greek writers, that is to the east of the Sarasvati, about twenty-five miles from the sea on the Swat valley.  Pānini mentions the Asmakas (iv.173).  The Mārkandeya Purāna and the Brhat Samhitā place Assaka to the north-west.  The Assaka capital, Potana, it has been suggested, is the Paudanya of the Mahābhārata (i.77, 47).  In the Commentary to Kautilya's Arthasāsta, Bhattasvāmi identifies Asmaka with Mahārāstra (Law, op.  cit., 22).[/p][p]Soon after the Buddha's death, a King Assaka was the ruler of Potali, and he and his son Sūjata were converted by Mahā Kaccānā (VvA.259-67).[/p][p]In the time of King Renu, the Assaka king of Potana was Brahmadatta (D.ii.236).[/p][p]In the Buddha's time the Assaka king is described as an Andhakarājā.  He took a thousand for the plot of land sold for Bāvarī's hermitage (SnA.ii.581).[/p]</e>

[/p][p][/p][p]The Brahmā was at first agitated by their presence, but later he was delighted on learning from Moggallāna, who was questioned by an attendant Brahmā, that there were many more disciples of the Buddha who could do as he and the others had done, and that they were holy men.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Araññavāsī Nikāya[/div][p]A group of monks in Ceylon who seem to have spent most of their time in solitary spots engaged in meditation.  They owed allegiance to the Mahāvihāra.  They are first heard of in the sixth century when, in the reign of Aggabodhi II., the King of Kalinga came over to Ceylon and joined the Order under the famous Elder Jotipāla.  This fraternity seems to have been closely associated with the Buddhists of Kālinga.  Among famous scholars belonging to it were: Ananda Vanaratanatissa, Vedeha, Cola Buddhappiya, Culla Dhammapāla, Medhankara, his pupil Ananda and Siddhattha.[/p][p]The Araññavāsins were specially esteemed by Parakkamabāhu of Dambadeniya.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Anomā[/div][hr][p]1. Anomā.-A river thirty leagues to the east of Kapilavatthu, where Gotama went after leaving home.

It was eight usabhas in breadth, but[/p][p]Kanthaka cleared it in one leap.

Three kingdoms lay between it and Kapilavatthu.  (BuA.5. The countries of the Sākiyans, Koliyans and Mallas; see Expositor i.43n., where Kapilavatthu, Devadaha and Koliya are mentioned as the three kingdoms).[/p][p][/p][p]From the river to Rājagaha was a distance of thirty leagues, which Gotama took seven days to walk (J.i.65; SnA.382).  It took him a whole night to ride from Kapilavatthu to Anomā (VvA.314).[/p][p]The name seems to have meant "Glorious," or "not Slight".  See J.i.64, where Gotama asks Channa the name of the river and Channa replies "It is Anoma (glorious)." "Good," says Gotama, "my renunciation shall also be anomā." The Burmese name is Anauma (Bigandet.  p.41).[/p][p][/p][p]Cunningham (*) identifies the river with the modern Aumi.  He states his belief that the word means "inferior," to distinguish it from other and larger rivers in the neighbourhood, and that the original name in Pali was Omā.  According to him the confusion in names arose from a misunderstanding of Channa's reply.  It is difficult to accept this suggestion because evidently, according to the tradition quoted in the Jātaka commentary and elsewhere, the name of the river was taken as a good augury for the accomplishment of Gotama's desires.[/p][blockquote][p](*) p.486ff.; in the Sutta Nipāta (vv.  153, 177) and again in the Samyutta (i.  33) the Buddha is spoken of as Anomanāma.  Buddhaghosa (SA.i.67) explains this as meaning having no "defect," endowed with perfection (sabbagunasamannāgatattā avekalla-nāmam; paripūranāmam).[/p][/blockquote][p]Thomas (Loc cit., p.  61 and n.1), on the other hand, suggests that Anomā did not necessarily really exist.  There was possibly an actual locality to the east of Kapilavatthu traditionally associated with Gotama's flight.  It was probably near Anupiya of the Malla country, and the names given to it, such as Anomā, Anomiya, Anuvaniya, Anumaniya, were corruptions of Anupiya in the popular dialects of the neighbourhood.

On the way back Sankha was recognised by an erstwhile servant of his whom he had given to Piliya.  This servant befriended Sankha and his wife, and with the help of his companions, brought to the king's notice Piliya's ingratitude.  The king, having tried the case, wished to give all Piliya's wealth to Sankha, but at the latter's request restored to him only what he had, in days of prosperity, given to Piliya.[/p][p]The story is related in reference to Devadatta's ingratitude.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Aputtaka[/div][p]A wealthy burgess of Sāvatthi who died intestate.  In the Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.89-91) we find Pasenadi, King of Kosala, visiting the Buddha at noonday and telling him that he had just finished having the banker's wealth removed to the royal coffers, "eight millions of gold to say nothing of silver." And yet Aputtaka ate nothing except sour husk-gruel left over from the previous day and wore only hempen garments.[/p][p][/p][p]In the next Sutta of the same Nikāya (S.i.91-3) the Buddha is reported as revealing the banker's past.  In a former birth he had given alms to a Pacceka Buddha, Tagarasikhī, but later he repented and wished that he had given the food to slaves and workmen.[/p][p]He had, in the same birth, slain the only son of his brother for the sake of his fortune.[/p][p][/p][p]As a result of the alms he was born seven times in the deva-worlds and seven times as a rich man of Sāvatthi.  His repentance made him inclined to deny himself enjoyment of sense-desires.  Owing to the murder of his nephew in his previous birth, he was childless in this, and he died intestate.  After this life he was born in Mahāroruva purgatory.  [/p][p][/p][p]The Mayhaka Jātaka (J.iii.299f.), contains the whole story of the banker's past and present, giving many graphic details not found in the Samyutta account, but it does not mention the seven births in heaven or in Sāvatthi.

For a time the experiment succeeds, but later, as a result of the king's scheming, the girl starts an intrigue with a flower-seller as lover and is discovered (J.i.289ff).

It is inhabited by men (KhA.123), but they have no houses and sleep on the ground (ThagA.ii.187-8).  In the centre of the continent is a Kadamba tree, whose trunk is fifteen yojanas in girth and whose trunk and arms are fifty yojanas in length.[/p][p]This tree stands for a whole kappa (DhsA.298; AA.i.264; Vm.206).  When the sun rises in Jambudīpa, it is the middle watch of the night in Aparagoyāna; sunset in Aparagoyāna is midnight in Jambudīpa, and sunrise is noon in Jambudīpa, sunset in Pubbavideha and midnight in Uttarakuru (DA.iii.868).  A cakkavatti-king first conquers Pubbavideha in the east and Jambudīpa in the south, and then sets out to win Aparagoyāna in the west and Uttarakuru in the north (Mbv.73-4; BuA.113).  Thus King Mandhātā, having conquered Jambudīpa, journeys on with his retinue to Aparagoyāna and conquers it straight away (Dvy.215).[/p][p]Punnaka, in his play with Dhanañjaya, staked a jewel, by gazing into which the continent of Aparagoyāna could be seen.  J.vi.278; so also in the necklace mentioned in the Hārapradāna Jātaka.  (Mtu.ii.68).[/p][p]In this context the name given is Goyāniya.  So also in the Mahāvastu: Aparagodānika, °godāniya (ii.159, 378, etc.).  In the Dulva it is called Aparagaudani (Rockhill, 84).[/p][p]Some of the inhabitants came with Mandhātā from Aparagoyāna to Jambudīpa and settled down there.  The country they colonised was called Aparanta.  DA.ii.482; MA.i.484.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Atthaka[/div][hr][p]1. Atthaka.-A celebrated sage, composer and reciter of sacred runes, mentioned together with nine others (Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Angirasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāsettha and Bhagu.  Vin.i.245; D.i.104; DA.i.273), as the ancient rsis of the brahmins.  They abstained from food at unseasonable times.  They were the first teachers of the Tevijja Brahmins (D.i.238) and great sacrifices were conducted by them (A.iv.61).[/p][p]Various teachings are attributed to them, e.g.  that they recognised five kinds of Brahmins - brahmasama, devasama, mariyāda, sambhinnamariyāda, and brāhmanacandāla (A.iii.224ff).  These sages did not claim to have discerned and realised the five qualities-truth, austerities, chastity, study and munificence - specified by the brahmins for the attainment of merit and the achievement of what is right (M.ii.199-200), though their followers behaved as if they did.  Nor did they claim that they personally saw and knew that "here alone resides the truth and everything else is vain." (M.ii.169) In the Vimānavatthu Commentary it is said that the Buddha had realised those things of which these sages thought and for which they wished (p.265).  (Brahmacintitan ti brahmehi Atthakādīhi cintitam, pañcacakkhunā dittham).[/p][p]It is said that Atthaka and the other seers had the divine eye and had incorporated the teachings of Kassapa Buddha into their own scriptures.  Thus (at that time) the three Vedas were in conformity with the Dhamma.  But later the brahmins went back on these teachings (DA.i.273).[/p][p]Atthaka is generally identified with Astaka mentioned as the author of Rg-veda x.104, unless the name be taken as a corrupt reading under which some representation of Atri may lurk.  VT.ii.130, n.2.[/p][hr][p][/p][p]2. Atthaka.-King.

Atthaka.-King.  Mentioned in a list of former kings who had followed righteousness and who, by waiting diligently on ascetics and recluses, had gone to Sakka's heaven.  J.vi.251.[/p][hr][p][/p][p]4. Atthaka.-King.  When Dandaka, having sinned against Kisavaccha, was destroyed with his realm, three of the subordinate lords within his kingdom - Kalinga, Atthaka and Bhīmaratha - went to consult the Bodhisatta Sarabhanga on the fate of Dandaka and his fellow-sinners.  Their doubts were set at rest, and at the end of Sarabhanga's discourse they became free of their sensuality (kāmarāga) (J.v.135-49).  Sakka himself was present at the interview and asked questions of Sarabhanga.[/p][hr][p][/p][p]5. Atthaka.-Pacceka Buddha.  Mentioned in a nominal list.  M.iii.70; Ap.i.107.[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Asita[/div][hr][p][b]1. Asita.[/b]-Often called the Buddhist Simeon, though the comparison is not quite correct.  He was a sage and the chaplain of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/siihahanu,Sīhahanu')"]Sīhahanu[/a], father of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suddhodana,Suddhodana')"]Suddhodana[/a].  He was the teacher of the Suddhodana, and later his chaplain.  He came morning and evening to see the king, Suddhodana, who showed him as great respect as he had while yet his pupil; this, we are told, is a characteristic of Sākiyan kings.  [/p][p]With the king's leave, Asita renounced the world and lived in the king's pleasance.  In due course he developed various iddhi powers.  Thenceforward he would often spend the day in the deva worlds.  Once, while in Tāvatimsa, he saw the whole city decked with splendour and the gods engaged in great rejoicing.  On inquiry he learnt that Siddhattha Gotama, destined to become the Buddha, had been born.  Immediately he went to Suddhodana's home and asked to see the babe.  From the auspicious marks on its body he knew that it would become the Enlightened One and was greatly overjoyed, but realising that he himself would, by then, be born in an Arūpa world and would not therefore be able to hear the Buddha preach, he wept and was sad.  Having reassured the king regarding the babe's future, Asita sought his sister's son, Nalaka, and ordained him that he might be ready to benefit by the Buddha's teaching when the time came.  Later Asita was born in the Arūpa world (Sn., pp.131-36; SnA.ii.483ff.; J.i.54f).[/p][p]According to Buddhaghosa (SnA.ii.483), Asita was so-called because of his dark complexion.  He also had a second name, Kanha Devala (SnA.ii.487).  Other names for him were Kanha Siri (Sn.v.689), Siri Kanha (SnA.487) and Kāla Devala (J.i.54).[/p][p]He is evidently to be distinguished from  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asita_devala,Asita Devala')"]Asita Devala[/a], also called Kāla Devala.[/p][p]The Lalita Vistara has two versions of Asita's prophecy, one in prose and one in verse, which, in their chief details, differ but slightly from the Pāli version.  In the former his nephew is called Naradatta, and Asita himself is represented as being a great sage dwelling in the Himālaya but unknown to Suddhodana.[/p][p]Here is evidently a confusion of his story with that of Asita Devala.  In the Mahāvastu version (ii.30f) he is spoken of as the son of a brahmin of Ujjeni, and he lives in a hermitage in the Vindhyā mountains.  It is noteworthy that in the Jātaka version he is called, not an isi, but a tāpasa, an ascetic practising austerities.  And there we are told that when the king brought the boy, the future Buddha, and prepared to make him do reverence to the ascetic, the babe's feet turned up and placed themselves on the ascetic's head.  For there is no one fit to be reverenced by a Bodhisatta, and had they put the babe's head at the feet of the ascetic, the ascetic's head would have split into seven pieces.[/p][p]The tāpasa could see forty kappas into the past and forty kappas into the future.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Anuruddha [/div][hr][p][b]1. Anuruddha Thera[/b][/p][p]First cousin of the Buddha and one of his most eminent disciples.  He was the son of the Sākyan Amitodana and brother of Mahānāma.  When members of other Sākyan families had joined the Order of their distinguished kinsman, Mahānāma was grieved that none had gone forth from his own.  He therefore suggested to his brother that one of them should leave household life.  Anuruddha was at first reluctant to agree, for he had been reared most delicately and luxuriously, dwelling in a different house for each season, surrounded by dancers and mimes.  But on hearing from Mahānāma of the endless round of household cares he agreed to go.  He could not, however, get his mother's consent until he persuaded his cousin Bhaddiya to go with him.  Together they went with Ananda, Bhagu, Kimbila, Devadatta and their barber Upāli, to the Blessed One at the Anupiya Mango Grove and were ordained.  Before the rainy season was over Anuruddha acquired the dibbacakkhu (Vin.ii.180-3; Mtu.iii.177f), and he was later ranked foremost among those who had obtained this attainment (A.i.23).[/p][p]He then received from Sāriputta, as topic of meditation, the eight thoughts of a great man.  The list is given in A.iv.228ff.  Another conversation he had with Sāriputta before becoming an arahant is reported in A.i.281-2. He went into the Pācīnavamsadāya in the Ceti country to practise these.  He mastered seven, but could not learn the eighth.  The Buddha, being aware of this, visited him and taught it to him.  Thereupon Anuruddha developed insight and realised arahantship in the highest grade (A.iv.  loc.  cit.; AA.108-9; Thag.901).[/p][p]Anuruddha appears in the Suttas as an affectionate and loyal comrade-bhikkhu, full of affection to his kinsman, the Buddha, who returned his love.  In the assembly he stood near the Buddha (Bu.v.60).  When the Buddha, disgusted with the quarrels of the Kosambī monks, went away to seek more congenial surroundings, it was to Pācīnavamsadāya that he repaired, where were Anuruddha, Nandiya and Kimbila.  The Upakkilesa Sutta (M.iii.153f.), on the sweets of concord and freedom from blemish, seems to have been preached specially to Anuruddha on that occasion, for we are told at the end that he was pleased to have heard it, no mention being made of the other two.  And again in the Nalakapāna Sutta (M.i.462ff.), though a large number of distinguished monks are present, it is to Anuruddha that the Buddha directly addresses his questions, and it is Anuruddha who answers on behalf of them all.  See also the Cūla- and the Mahā-Gosinga Suttas.[/p][p]Anuruddha was present when the Buddha died at Kusinārā, and knew the exact moment of his death; the verse he uttered on that occasion is thoughtful and shows philosophic calm, in contrast, for example, with that of Ananda.  D.ii.156-7. On this see Oldenberg, Nachrichten der Wissenschaften zu Goettingen, 1902, pp.168f.; and Przyluski JA.  mai-juin, 1918, pp.486ff.[/p][p]Anuruddha was foremost in consoling the monks and admonishing them as to their future course of action.  It was Anuruddha again that the Mallas of Kusinārā consulted regarding the Buddha's last obsequies (D.ii.160f).  Later, at the First Council, he played a prominent part and was entrusted with the custody of the Anguttara Nikāya (DA.i.15).[/p][p]In one of the verses ascribed to Anuruddha in the Theragāthā (904; ThagA.ii.72) it is said that for twenty-five years he did not sleep at all, and that for the last thirty years of his life he slept only during the last watch of the night.  The same source (Thag.908; also S.i.200) mentions an occasion where a goddess, Jālinī (ThagA.ii.73; this story is given in detail in SA.i.225-6), who had been his wife in a previous birth, seeing him grown old and grey with meditation, seeks to tempt him with the joys of heaven, but he tells her he has no need of such things, having attained to freedom from rebirth.[/p][p]His death took place in Veluvagāma in the Vajji country, in the shade of a bamboo thicket.  Thag.919. See also Psalms of the Brethren, p.331, n.1. I cannot trace the reference to Hatthigāma.  He was one hundred and fifteen years old at the time of his death (DA.ii.413).[/p][p]In Padumuttara Buddha's time he had been a rich householder.  Hearing one of the monks declared best among possessors of the celestial eye, he wished for a similar honour for himself in the future.  He did acts of great merit towards that end, including the holding of a great feast of light in front of the Buddha's tomb.  In Kassapa Buddha's age he was born in Benares; one day he placed bowls filled with clarified butter all round the Buddha's tomb and lighted them, himself walking round the tomb all night, bearing on his head a lighted bowl.[/p][p]Later he was reborn in a poor family in Benares and was named Annabhāra (lit.  "food-bearer").  One day, while working for his master, the banker Sumana, he gave his meal to a Pacceka Buddha, Uparittha.  The banker, having heard from the deity of his parasol of Annabhāra's pious deed, rewarded him and set him up in trade.  The king, being pleased with him, gave him a site for a house, the ground of which, when dug, yielded much buried treasure.  On account of this great accretion of wealth he was given the rank of Dhanasetthi (ThagA.ii.65ff.; Thag.910; DhA.iv.120ff).[/p][p]According to the Dhammapada Commentary (i.113), as a result of his gift to the Pacceka Buddha, Anuruddha never lacked anything he desired - such had been the wish he expressed.  A charming story is related in this connection.  Once when playing at ball with his friends he was beaten and had to pay with sweets.  His mother sent him the sweets, but he lost over and over again until no more sweets were to be had.  His mother sent word to that effect, but he did not know the meaning of the words "there isn't." When his mother, to make him understand, sent him an empty bowl, the guardian deity of the city filled it with celestial cakes, so that he should not be disappointed.  Thereafter, whenever Anuruddha sent for cakes, his mother would send him an empty vessel, which became filled on the way.  See also DhA.iv.124ff.[/p][p]The Apadāna (i.35) mentions another incident of his past.  Once, in Sumedha Buddha's time, Anuruddha, having seen the Buddha meditating alone at the foot of a tree, set up lights round him and kept them burning for seven days.  As a result he reigned for thirty kappas as king of the gods, and was king of men twenty-eight times.  He could see a distance of a league both by day and night.[/p][p]On various occasions Anuruddha had discussions with the Buddha, and he was consulted by disciples, both monks and laymen, on points of doctrine and practice.  In the Anuruddha Sutta (M.iii.144f) he goes with Abhiya Kaccāna and two others to a meal at the house of Pañcakanga, the king's carpenter.  At the end of the meal the carpenter asks him the difference between that deliverance of the heart (cetovimutti) that is boundless (appamāna) and that which is vast (mahaggata).  The discussion leads on to an account of the four states of rebirth among the brilliant gods (Ābhā), and in reply to the questions of Abhiya Kaccāna, Anuruddha proceeds to explain their nature.  At the end of the discourse we find Anuruddha acknowledging that he himself had lived among these gods.[/p][p]In the Samyutta Nikāya (S.iv.240-5) he is mentioned as questioning the Buddha about women, how they come to be born in happy states and how in woeful purgatory.  A similar inquiry is mentioned in the Anguttara Nikāya.  Anuruddha had been visited by some Manāpakāyikā devas, who had played and sung to him and shown their power of changing their complexions at will.  He comes to the Buddha and asks how women could be born among these devas (A.iv.262ff).[/p][p]We find him (S.v.174-6, also 299f) being asked by Samyutta and Moggallāna about the sekha and asekha and about super-knowledge (abhiññā).  In dealing with this passage the Commentary (SA.iii.183) states that Anuruddha used to rise early, and that after ablutions he sat in his cell, calling up a thousand kappas of the past and the future.  With his clairvoyant eye he knew the thousand fold universe and all its workings.[/p][p]The Anuruddha Samyutta (S.v.294) gives an account of a series of questions asked by Moggallāna on the satipatthānā, their extent, etc.  Anuruddha evidently laid great emphasis on the cultivation of the satipatthānā, for we find mention of them occurring over and over again in his discourses.  He attributes all his powers to their development, and admonishes his hearers to practise them.  S.v.299-306. He himself considered the dibbacakkhu as the highest attainment.  Thus in the Mahāgosinga Sutta (M.i.213) he declares it to be more worthy than knowledge of the doctrine, meditation, forest-life, discourse on the abhidhamma or self-mastery.[/p][p]Once he lay grievously ill in the Andhavana in Sāvatthi, but the pain made no impression on his mind, because, he says, his mind was well grounded in the satipatthānā (S.v.302, but see DhA.iv.129, where he suffered from wind in the stomach).  Apart from his teaching of the satipatthānā, he does not seem to have found fame as a teacher.  He was of a retiring disposition and never interfered in any of the monks' quarrels.[/p][p]Mention is often made of Anuruddha's iddhi-powers.  Thus, he was one of those who went to the Brahma-world to curb the pride of the Brahma who had thought that no ascetic could reach his world (S.i.145. The others being Moggallāna, Mahākassapa and Mahākappina).  The mother of the Yakkha Piyankara, while wandering in search of food, heard him at night reciting some verses from the Dhammapada and stood spellbound listening (S.i.209; SA.i.237-8).[/p][p]His iddhi, however, does not seem to have enabled him to prevent his fellow-dweller Abhiñjika from talking too much (S.ii.203-4), nor his other fellow-dweller Bāhiya from attempting to create dissension in the Order (A.ii.239).  Among the Vajjians he seems to have been held particularly in esteem, together with Nandiya and Kimbila.  A yakkha named Dīgha tells the Buddha how the Vajjians are envied by the inhabitants of the deva and brahma worlds on account of the presence of these distinguished monks in their country (in the Cūlagosinga Sutta, M.i.210).[/p][p]In numerous Jātakas Anuruddha is identified with personalities occurring in the Atītavatthu.  In several cases he is mentioned as having been Sakka, the deus ex machina of the story in question.  Thus in the Manicora (J.ii.125); Guttila (ii.257); Ayakūta (iii.147); Mahāsūka (iii.494); Cullasūka (iii.496); Kanha (iv.14); Akitti (iv.242); Sādhīna (iv.360); Siri (iv.412); Mahāsutasoma (v.511); Sāma (vi.95); Nimi (vi.129); Mahāsumagga (vi.329); Vessantara (vi.593).[/p][p]Elsewhere he is identified with different personalities: [/p][ul][li]he was Pabbata in the Indriya (iii.469) and in the Sarabhanga (v.151); [/li][li]the king in the Candakinnara (iv.288); [/li][li]one of the seven brothers in the Bhisa (iv.314); [/li][li]the dove in the Pañcūposatha (iv.332); [/li][li]Ajapāla in the Hatthipāla (iv.491); [/li][li]Sucirata in the Sambhava (v.67); [/li][li]Pañcasikha in the Sudhdābojana (v.412) and [/li][li]the charioteer in the Kurudhamma (ii.381).[/li][/ul][p]Anuruddha's name occurs in several of the legends of the Dhammapada Commentary apart from those already mentioned.  In the story of Cūlasubhaddā it is stated that after the Buddha had visited Ugganagara at Cūlasubhadda's request and enjoyed her hospitality, Anuruddha was asked to stay behind at Ugganagara for her benefit and that of the new converts (DhA.iii.471).  When the Buddha spent a rainy season in Tāvatimsa preaching the Abhidhamma, it was Anuruddha who kept the people on earth informed of his doings.  DhA.iii.218f.; SnA.  (ii.570), states that the Buddha went to Tāvatimsa at Anuruddha's request.[/p][p]In the Sumanasāmanera Vatthu (DhA.iv.120ff ) we are told how Anuruddha, having himself attained salvation, sought for his friend and benefactor of a past birth, Sumana-setthi.  Sumana-setthi had been born near the Vindhyā forest as Cūllasumana, son of Anuruddha's acquaintance Mahāmunda, and Anuruddha ordained him at the age of seven.  The lad became arahant in the tonsure-hall.[/p][p]According to the Peta Vatthu (Pv., p.27, vv.  58-60), it was by virtue of a spoonful of food given by him to Anuruddha that Indaka entered Tāvatimsa, and the same gift enabled him to surpass in glory Ankura, who had spent all his wealth in practising generosity.[/p][p]Anuruddha had a sister, Rohinī, who suffered from a skin disease and, therefore, remained indoors; she would not see the Elder when he visited her relations.  But he insisted on seeing her and persuaded her to sell her ornaments and build a resting hall for the Buddha and his monks.  She later became a Stream-enterer and was reborn as Sakka's consort (DhA.iii.295f).[/p][p]In Mahāyāna books Anuruddha's name appears as Aniruddha.  In the Lalitavistara he is mentioned as wearing the Bodhisatta's ornaments when the latter renounced the world.  He is sometimes spoken of as a son of Dronodana.  Thus, e.g., Mtu i.75; iii.117. See Beal, Records of Western World, ii.38 n.  for meaning of Anuruddha.  According to the Dulva, it was Anuruddha who, finding Ananda still asekha, got him turned out of the First Council until he became an arahant (Rockhill, p.151).[/p][hr][p][b]2.

In the Divyāvadāna (p.359) Anuruddha's name does not appear at all in the list of Bimbisāra's successors.[/p][hr][p][b]4. Anuruddha.[/b]-Personal attendant of Piyadassi Buddha.  It was in reply to his question that the Buddha revealed the future attainments of Nigrodha Thera (ThagA.i.75; Ap.i.431) and of Tissa Thera (ThagA.i.273).[/p][hr][p][b]5.

He once offered to the Sangha a bowl filled with ghee.  The incident is mentioned in a discussion as to whether a bowl that had been bought for a particular monk, could be used by the community of monks (Sp.iii.698-9).  This bowl had been bought for the Elder, but it was used by the community and was, therefore, kappiya.[/p][hr][p][b]8. Anuruddha.[/b]-King of Ramañña.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Atthinukhopariyāya Sutta[/div][p]Is there a method by following which a monk could affirm that he has won insight? "Yes," answers the Buddha; a monk beholding an object or hearing a sound, etc., recognises it with the eye of wisdom and of reason, whether it produces in him lust, etc., or not.  This method leads to insight apart from belief, hearsay, etc.  S.i.138.[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Araññakutikā[/div][p]Mention is made of several forest hermitages in the Buddha's time.  There was one, for instance, near Rājagaha, where Mahā Moggallāna (J.iii.33) used to spend his time and also Mahā Kassapa (J.iii.71).  Evidently other monks of the Order dwelt there from time to time, e.g.  the novice Aciravata (M.iii.128).  There was one hermitage near Dīghambalika (DhA.ii.235) and another near Himavā (DhA.ii.31, 129), where the Buddha sometimes went.[/p]</e>

From the city of Jetuttara to Suvannagiritāla was five leagues and it was five leagues more to Kontimāra; thence to Arañjaragiri was five and again five to Dunni-vittha (J.vi.514).

[/p][p]He was responsible for the conversion of Sāriputta and Moggallāna.  Sāriputta, in the course of his wanderings in search of Eternal Truth, saw Assaji begging for alms in Rājagaha, and being pleased with his demeanour, followed him till he had finished his round.  Finding a suitable opportunity, Sāriputta asked Assaji about his teacher and the doctrines he followed.  Assaji was at first reluctant to preach to him, because, as he said, he was but young in the Order.  But Sāriputta urged him to say what he knew, and the stanza which Assaji uttered then, has, ever since, been famous, as representing the keynote of the Buddha's teaching:[/p][p]"ye dhammā hetuppabhavā tesam hetum Tathāgato āha tesañ ca yo nirodho, evamvādī Mahāsamano."[/p][p]Sāriputta immediately understood and hurried to give the glad tidings to Moggallāna that he had succeeded in his quest.  Vin.i.39ff.; the incident is related in the DhA (i.75ff.) with slight variations as to detail.[/p][p]Sāriputta held Assaji in the highest veneration, and we are told that from the day of this first meeting, in whatever quarter he heard that Assaji was staying, in that direction he would extend his clasped hands in an attitude of reverent supplication, and in that direction he would turn his head when he lay down to sleep (DhA.iv.150-1).[/p][p]One day when Assaji was going about in Vesāli for alms, the Nigantha Saccaka, who was wandering about in search of disputants to conquer, saw him, and questioned him regarding the Buddha's teaching because he was a well-known disciple (ñātaññatara-sāvaka).  Assaji gave him a summary of the doctrine contained in the Anattalakkhana Sutta.  Feeling sure that he could refute these views attributed to the Buddha, Saccaka went with a large concourse of Licchavis to the Buddha and questioned him.  This was the occasion for the preaching of the Cula-Saccaka Sutta (M.i.227ff).  The Commentary (MA.i.452) tells us that Assaji decided on this method of exposition because he did not wish to leave Saccaka any loophole for contentious questioning.  [/p][p]The Samyutta Nikāya (S.iii.124ff) records a visit paid by the Buddha to Assaji as he lay grievously sick in Kassapārāma near Rājagaha.  He tells the Buddha that he cannot enter into jhāna because of his difficulty in breathing and that he cannot win balance of mind.

On enquiry he learnt the reason and told it to the Buddha, who was then at the Aggālava-cetiya.  The Buddha rebuked the monks, saying that formerly samanas and recluses, even though offered their choice by kings, never asked for alms, holding that begging from others was neither agreeable nor pleasant.  The Manikantha Jātaka (J.ii.282ff) was also preached on the same occasion.[/p]</e>

Like an iron ball heated throughout the day, or a tuft of cotton seed on a ball of thistledown, wafted lightly on the wind, so the body, at such time, rises from the ground into the air and takes on manifold forms of magic power (S.v.282-4).[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Ariyagālatissa[/div][p]Son of Mahādhanadeva, of Mahāgāma.  When he was a child he was called Keliyatissa, because he liked to play.  Later he joined the Order.  Dissatisfied after five years, he gave up his robes and swam down a river.  Two women bathing saw him and both claimed him.  When they saw he was naked one went to fetch clothes; the other gave him half her garment and took him to her parents and married him.  The wife was Sumanā.  Because he was found in the river he was called Ganga-tissa; but because he was lazy they called him Nikkammatissa.  Sumanā's people complained of him and sent them away.  Tissa sought work under a headman, Candasuriya, a friend of Mahādhanadeva, and reaped and threshed a field of 500 karīsas in one day.  Candasuriya, marvelling at his strength, gave him all the grain.[/p][p]Thereafter, Tissa and his wife gave alms daily to eight monks, but as his meals were not tasty, the monks called him Udakalonatissa.  Discovering this, he gave them milk rice and was called Khīrabhatta-tissa.  Later he gave rice mixed with ghee and his name became Kalyānabhatta-tissa.  In due course he fed 500 monks daily.  One day, while looking for yams in Kumbulapabbata, he discovered 60 treasure troves and took them home.  Later he fed many thousands of monks in Cetiyamba-vihāra, Anurādhapura and Nāgadīpa and lived in Ariyagālatittha as a ferryman, taking people across, free of charge.  Sakka, wishing to test him, came as an old brahmin and, having tried his patience, filled his house with valuables and gave him a field of rice.[/p][p]Once a discussion arose in Piyangudīpa, as to where the most devout people were to be found.  Satisambodhi Thera said they were in Ceylon, while Yonakarājaputta Mahābuddharakkhita said they were in Yonakarattha.  To test this, Satisambodhi arrived in Tissa's house.  His wife, having fed 12,000 monks, was resting, but having seen the Elder she prepared for him a bowl of catuma-dhura.  He asked her to throw the bowl up into the air.  It travelled to Piyangudīpa, and Sumanā saw the monks as they ate the contents.[/p][p]As Tissa lay dying, devas brought him chariots from the six deva worlds; he chose to be born in Tusita.  His wife, knowing his wishes, retired into her room and died before him.  They were both born in Tusita.  In a past birth Tissa had been in Chagāma and honoured the Bodhi-tree there.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Andhakavinda[/div][p]A village in the Magadha country, three gāvuta from Rājagaha.  Between it and Rājagaha is the river Sappinī, which rises in the Gijjhakūta (Vin.i.109; Vin.  Texts i.254, n.2).  Once the Buddha went from Benares to Andhakavinda with 1,250 monks, and many people followed them carrying cartloads of provisions that they might feed them in turn.  There were so many awaiting their turn that a certain brahmin (referred to as Andhakavindabrāhmana) had to wait two months for his to come round.  At the end of two months, finding that his own affairs were going to ruin and that there was no likelihood of his turn coming soon, the brahmin went to the provision-room to see what deficiency he could possibly supply.  Seeing there neither rice, milk, nor honey-lumps, he approached Ananda, and having, through him, obtained the Buddha's permission, the brahmin prepared a meal of milk-rice and honey-lumps for the Buddha and the monks.  At the conclusion of the meal the Buddha spoke of the tenfold good qualities of milk-rice.  Vin.i.220f.; it was this praise uttered by the Buddha that made Visākhā ask him, as a favour, that she should be allowed to supply milk-rice to the monks throughout her life (ibid., 293); see also UdA.112.[/p][p]During the same visit of the Buddha, a newly converted minister of the district prepared meat dishes for the fraternity, but being disappointed that the monks, who had had a meal of solid milk-rice earlier, could not eat large quantities of his dishes, he was rather rude to them.  Later he expressed remorse, and the Buddha assured him that heaven would be his inheritance (Vin.i.222f.  This was the occasion for the rule that monks who have been invited to a meal in one place should not accept milk-rice somewhere else earlier in the same day.).  It was on the way back from Andhakavinda to Rājagaha that the Buddha met Belattha Kaccāna (Vin.i.224f).[/p][p]Once when the Buddha was staying at Andhakavinda the Brahmā Sahampati came and lighted the place with his effulgent beauty till late at night; then he sought the Buddha and sang before him verses of exhortation meant for the monks, urging them to lead the holy life (S.i.154).  Here, too, the Buddha mentioned to Ananda the necessity of admonishing and encouraging new members of the Order with regard to five things: good conduct, control of the faculties of sense, abstinence from too much talking, love of solitude and the cultivation of right views (A.iii.138-9; referred to in Sp.iv.789).  Once in Andhakavinda the Buddha suffered from disease of the wind.  Ananda was asked to obtain gruel for the complaint.  The wife of the village physician supplied the gruel with great devotion, and as a result was born in Tāvatimsa, where her abode was known as the Kañjikādāyika vimāna (VvA.185-6).  Another lay devotee built a Gandhakuti for the Buddha at Andhakavinda, and personally looked after the Buddha while he was there.  This upāsaka was also, as a result, born in Tāvatimsa in a golden vimāna (VvA.302-3).[/p][p]Cūlasetthi's daughter, Anulā, lived in Andhakavinda after her marriage and it was there that she gave alms on behalf of her dead father (PvA.105-9).[/p]</e>

But when Apacara came to the throne, Kapila obtained the post for his own son and became an ascetic.

Then the Buddha proceeded to ask the monks their names, and noticing that the fisherman himself expected to be questioned, he asked him his.  On learning that it was Ariya, the Buddha suggested to him that he was unworthy of the name, because a real Ariya never injured any living thing.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Apalāla[/div][p]A nāga king, converted by the Buddha..  He is mentioned together with Āravāla, Dhanapāla and Pārileyyaka.  The name appears in passages where the Buddha's powers are discussed (E.g., BuA.29).  "Was not the Buddha honoured even by beasts such as Āravāla, etc.?"[/p][p][/p][p]The story of the conversion of Apalāla does not, as far as I can discover, occur in the canonical books.  In the Samantapāsādikā (iv.742) the story of the conversion of Apalāla (Apalāladamana) is given among the stories not included in the Three Councils (sangīti), but that it was known quite early in Ceylon is evidenced by the fact that, among the scenes from the Buddha's life represented in the relic-chamber of the Mahā-Thūpa, the conversion of Apalāla is mentioned (Mhv.xxx.84).  The Divyāvadāna (pp.348, 385) makes reference to the story, and states that the nāga was converted shortly before the Buddha's death.  Hiouen Thsang gives the story in detail (Beal: Records of the Western World i.122; also Legge: Fa Hien's Travels, p.29n.).  During Kassapa Buddha's time, Apalāla had been a powerful man called Gangi.  By means of his charms he subdued the dragons that attacked the country, and the people, in gratitude, agreed to give him tribute.  Later some of them forgot their promise and he, in wrath, became a dragon after his death.[/p][p][/p][p]The Buddha Gotama visited him and preached to him.  He was converted, but, for his sustenance, he was allowed to have one gathering of the crops every twelve years.  It is for this reason that the White River (Subhavastu) overflows every twelfth year.  The story is found in the Sūtrālankāra and other Mahāyāna books.  See Nariman: Sanskrit Buddhism, pp.194, 274. [/p][p][/p][p]According to the Vinaya of the Mūlla-Sarvāstivādins, the Buddha converted Apalāla during a visit to Kashmir in the company of the Yaksa Vajrapānī (JA.1914, vol.  iv.510).[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Anomadassī[/div][hr][p]1. Anomadassī.-The seventh Buddha.  He was born in the park Sunanda in Candavatī, his parents being Yasavā and Yasodharā.  He lived in three palaces: Siri, Upasiri and Vaddha (Sirivaddha, according to BuA.).  His wife was Sirimā and his son Upavāna.  He renounced household life at the age of 10,000 years, leaving home in a palanquin, and practised austerities for ten months.  A maiden, Anupamā, gave him a meal of milk-rice before his Enlightenment, and the ājīvaka, Anoma, provided him with grass for his seat, his Bodhi being an ajjuna tree.[/p][p]His first sermon was preached in the park Sudassana in Subhavatī.  The Twin-Miracle was performed at Osadhī at the foot of an asana tree.  Nisabha and Asoka (v.l.  Anoma) were chief among his monks, and Sundarī and Sumanā among his nuns.  Among laymen, Nandivaddha and Sirivaddha were his foremost supporters, and among laywomen, Uppalā and Padumā.[/p][p]King Dhammaka was his royal patron; his constant attendant was Varuna.  He lived to be 100,000 years old and died at Dhammārāma.  He held three assemblies at which were present 800,000, 700,000 and 600,000 respectively.[/p][p]The Bodhisatta was a powerful yakkha-chief and entertained the Buddha and his following (Bu.x.; BuA.141-6).[/p][p]It was a sermon preached by Nisabha and Anoma, the chief disciples of this Buddha, that made Sarada-tāpasa (Sāriputta in his last birth) wish to become an aggasāvaka himself.  Later, Sirivaddha (Moggallāna), at Sarada's suggestion, entertained the Buddha and wished for the post of second disciple under Gotama (DhA.i.88-94).[/p][p]Bakkula Thera was an ascetic in Anomadassī's day.  The Buddha once suffered from an abdominal affliction and it was this ascetic who cured him(AA.i.169; Mil.216).[/p][p]It is said that at Anomadassī's birth seven kinds of jewels rained down from the sky and that this was the reason for his name.

His story appears both in the Majjhima Cy., 743ff., and in the Thag.  Cy., ii.57ff.  The two accounts differ in certain details; I have summarised the two versions.[/p][p]He was the son of the brahmin [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaggava,Bhaggava')"]Bhaggava[/a], chaplain to the king of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosala,Kosala')"]Kosala[/a], his mother being [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mantaanii,Mantānī')"]Mantānī[/a].  He was born under the thieves' constellation, and on the night of his birth all the armour in the town shone, including that belonging to the king.  Because this omen did no harm to anyone the babe was named Ahimsaka.  The Thag.  Cy.  says he was first called Himsaka and then Ahimsaka.  See also Ps.  of the Brethren, 323, n.3.[/p][p]At  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/takkasilaa,Takkasilā')"]Takkasilā[/a] he became a favourite at the teacher's house, but his jealous fellow-students poisoned his teacher's mind, and the latter, bent on his destruction, asked as his honorarium a thousand human right-hand fingers.  Thereupon Ahimsaka waylaid travellers in the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jaalinii,Jālinī')"]Jālinī[/a] forest in Kosala and killed them, taking a finger from each.  The finger-bones thus obtained he made into a garland to hang round his neck, hence the name Angulimāla.[/p][p]As a result of his deeds whole villages were deserted, and the king ordered a detachment of men to seize the bandit, whose name nobody knew.  But Angulimāla's mother, guessing the truth, started off to warn him.  By now he lacked but one finger to complete his thousand, and seeing his mother coming he determined to kill her.  But the Buddha, seeing his upanissaya, went himself to the wood, travelling thirty yojanas, (DA.i.240; J.iv.180) and intercepted Angulimāla on his way to slay his mother.  Angulimāla was converted by the Buddha's power and received the "ehi bhikkhu pabbajjā" (Thag.868-70) while the populace were yelling at the king's palace for the robber's life.  Later, the Buddha presented him before King  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasenadi,Pasenadi')"]Pasenadi[/a] when the latter came to  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana,Jetavana')"]Jetavana[/a], and Pasenadi, filled with wonder, offered to provide the monk with all requisites.

The words he used in this saccakiriyā (yato aham sabbaññutabuddhassa ariyassa ariyāya jātiyā jāto) have come to be regarded as a paritta to ward off all dangers and constitute the Angulimāla Paritta.  The water that washed the stone on which he sat in the woman's house came to be regarded as a panacea (M.ii.103-4; MA.747f).[/p][p]In the Angulimāla Sutta he is addressed by Pasenādi as Gagga Mantānīputta, his father being a Gagga.  The story is evidently a popular one and occurs also in the Avadāna Sataka (No.27).[/p][p]At the Kosala king's  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asadisadaana,Asadisadāna')"]Asadisadāna[/a], an untamed elephant, none other being available, was used to bear the parasol over Angulimāla.  The elephant remained perfectly still - such was Angulimāla's power (DhA.iii.185; also DA.ii.654).[/p][p]The conversion of Angulimāla is often referred to as a most compassionate and wonderful act of the Buddha's, e.g.  in the Sutasoma Jātaka, (J.v.456f.; see also J.iv.180; SnA.ii.440; DhA.i.124) which was preached concerning him.  The story of Angulimāla is quoted as that of a man in whose case a beneficent kamma arose and destroyed former evil kamma (AA.i.369).[/p][p]It was on his account that the rule not to ordain a captured robber was enacted (Vin.i.74).[/p][p]For his identification with Kalmāsapāda see J.P.T.S., 1909, pp.  240ff.[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Rohitassa[/div][hr][p][b]1. Rohitassa[/b].  A devaputta.  He once visited the Buddha at Jetavana and asked if one could, by travelling, reach the end of the world where there would be no birth, old age, death, etc.  The Buddha said that such was not possible.  The devaputta then confessed that he had, in a previous life, been a sage called Rohitassa, a Bhojaputta of great psychic powers, able in one stride to cross from the western ocean to the eastern.  The Commentary (SA.i.92) adds that he would wash in the Anotatta Lake and go to eat in Uttarakuru.  With such a stride, he had travelled for one hundred years, and yet failed to reach the world's end, where there was no birth, old age, death, etc.  That was true, agreed the Buddha; in this fathom long body is the world, its origin, its making and end, likewise the practice which leads to such end.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Rathavinīta Sutta[/div][p]The twenty fourth sutta of the Majjhima Nikāya.  Sāriputta visits Punna Mantāniputta in Andhavana and asks him why he lives the higher life.  To attain absolute Nibbāna, answers Punna, and, on being questioned further as to the nature of Nibbāna, he explains that Nibbāna is the goal and can only be attained by passing through various successive stages purity of life, purity of heart, purity of view, purity through dispelling doubts, purity through full insight into paths, right and wrong, into the path to be followed, and the purity which arises from insight.  It may be compared to a journey of Pasenadi from Sāvatthi to Sāketa, by means of relays of seven carriages.[/p][p]It is said in the introduction to the sutta that Sāriputta had been awaiting the opportunity of a discussion with Punna ever since he heard the monks at Veluvana in Rājagaha speak of him to the Buddha in terms of the highest praise.  But this opportunity did not arise until later, when Punna visited Sāvatthi.  Punna was unaware of the identity of Sāriputta until the end of his discourse (M.i.145 51).[/p][p]The Mahāvamsa Tīkā mentions (MT.552f ) that once Ambapāsānavāsī Cittagutta preached this sutta to a very large assembly of monks and nuns at the Lohapāsāda in Anurādhapura, and in his exposition of the sutta included a short account of the relies enshrined in the Mahā Thūpa.[/p][p]It has been suggested by Dr.  Neumann that the upatisapasina mentioned in Asoka's Bhabru Edict, refers to this sutta.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Rājakārāma[/div][p]A monastery in Sāvatthi, near Jetavana, built by Pasenadi (J.ii.15).  It was to the south east of the city, corresponding to Thūpārāma in Anurādhapura.  (MA.ii.1021).  It was there that the Nandakovāda Sutta was preached (M.iii.271).  This was probably the monastery built for nuns by Pasenadi, at the Buddha's suggestion, after the assault on Uppalavannā in Andhavana, referred to in the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.ii.52).  [/p][p]The Samyutta Commentary, however, gives a different account (SA.iii.218f.; the introductory story of the Bharu Jātaka; J.ii.170, gives the same account but omits the statement that the king built a vihāra).  It states that the heretics, jealous of the Buddha and his popularity, desired to build a monastery for themselves in close proximity to Jetavana, and, in order that he might raise no objections, they presented Pasenadi with one hundred thousand.  [/p][p]When the Buddha discovered their intentions, owing to the great uproar they made while preparing the preliminaries of the building, he sent Ananda to the king, asking to have it stopped.  But Pasenadi refused to see him or Sāriputta or Moggallāna.  (It was as a punishment for this discourtesy that he lost the throne before his death.) Thereupon the Buddha went himself.  Pasenadi received him and entertained him to a meal, at the end of which the Buddha preached to him the Bharu Jātaka (q.v.) on the evils of bribery and of creating an opportunity for virtuous people to quarrel among themselves.  Pasenadi was filled with remorse; he had the heretics expelled, and, realizing that he had never built a monastery, proceeded to construct the Rājakārama.[/p][p]The Samyutta Nikāya (S.v.360ff ) contains several sermons preached by the Buddha at the Rājakārāma.[/p]</e>

Roja was Ananda's friend, and Ananda was pleased when he arrived to pay homage to the Buddha, but when Roja said that he did so only out of regard for his kinsmen's decree, Ananda was bitterly disappointed and asked the Buddha to discover some means by which Roja could be made to become his follower.  The Buddha agreed to do this, and by means of the power of his compassion, Roja was induced to visit him again.  The Buddha preached to Roja, who asked, as a boon, that the monks should accept hospitality only from him.  This request was refused by the Buddha, who said that Roja must take his turn with others in showing hospitality to him and his monks.  Finding that he had long to wait for his turn, Roja made enquiries, and, discovering that the monks had no supply of green vegetables (dāka) or pastry (pittakhādaniya), he consulted Ananda, and, with the Buddha's sanction, offered these things to the Buddha and his monks (Vin.i.247ff).  It is said (J.ii.231f) that Roja once invited Ananda to his house, and, after entertaining him lavishly, tried to induce him to leave the Order by offering him half his wealth.  But Ananda refused this offer, explaining to him the miseries involved in household life.  Later, Ananda repeated this conversation to the Buddha, who related the Vacchanakha Jātaka (q.v.) to show that Roja and Ananda had been friends in a past life too.[/p][p]Once Roja forced on Ananda a linen cloth (khomapilotikā); Ananda had need of it, and accepted it with the Buddha's permission (Vin.i.296).[/p][hr][p][b]2.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Rāhula [/div][hr][h4]1. Rāhula Thera[/h4][p]Only son of Gotama Buddha.  He was born on the day on which his father left the household life (J.i.60; AA.i.82, etc.; cf.  J.i.62).  When the Buddha visited Kapilavatthu for the first time after his Enlightenment and accepted Suddhodana's invitation, Rāhula's mother (Rāhulamātā) sent the boy to the Buddha to ask for his inheritance (dāyajja).  The Buddha gave him no answer, and, at the conclusion of the meal, left the palace.  Rāhula followed him, reiterating his request until at last the Buddha asked Sāriputta to ordain him.  (According to SNA.i.340, Moggallāna taught him the kammavācā; see also J.ii.393).  When Suddhodana heard of this he protested to the Buddha, and asked as a boon that, in future, no child should be ordained without the consent of his parents, and to this the Buddha agreed (Vin.i.82f.; the story of Rāhula's conversion is also given at DhA.i.98f).[/p][p]It is said (AA.i.145) that immediately after Rāhula's ordination the Buddha preached to him constantly (abhinhovādavasena) many suttas for his guidance.  Rāhula himself was eager to receive instruction from the Buddha and his teachers and would rise early in the morning and take a handful of sand, saying: "May I have today as many words of counsel from my teachers as there are here grains of sand!" The monks constantly spoke of Rāhula's amenability, and one day the Buddha, aware of the subject of their talk, went amongst them and related the Tipallatthamiga Jātaka (J.i.160ff ) and the Tittira Jātaka (J.iii.64ff ) to show them that in past births, too, Rāhula had been known for his obedience.  When Rāhula was seven years old, the Buddha preached to him the Ambalatthika Rāhulovāda Sutta (q.v.) as a warning that he should never lie, even in fun.  Rāhula used to accompany the Buddha on his begging rounds.  Sometimes he would accompany Sāriputta on his begging rounds.  He was present when Sāriputta went to his (Sāriputta's) mother's house, where he was roundly abused by her for having left her.  DhA.iv.164f).  [/p][p]Rāhula noticed that he harboured carnal thoughts fascinated by his own physical beauty and that of his father, the Buddha preached to him, at the age of eighteen, the Mahā Rāhulovāda Sutta (q.v.).  Two other suttas, also called Rāhulovāda, one included in the Samyutta and the other in the Anguttara (see below), formed the topics for Rāhula's meditation (Vipassanā).  To these Suttas Buddhaghosa (MA.i.635) adds the Sāmanera, or Kumārapañhā, and proceeds to enumerate the different purposes which the Buddha had in view in preaching these suttas; see also AA.ii.547. SNA.i.340 says, about the Rāhula Sutta (q.v.), that the Buddha constantly preached it to Rāhula.  See also the Rāhula Samyutta.[/p][p]Later, the Buddha, knowing that Rāhula's mind was ripe for final attainment, went with him alone to Andhavana, and preached to him the Cūla Rāhulovāda Sutta.  At the end of the discourse, Rāhula became an arahant, together with one hundred thousand crores of listening devas.  SA.iii.26 says these devas were among those who, in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, had heard Rāhula's wish to be born as the son of a future Buddha.  They were subsequently born in various deva worlds, but on this day they all assembled at Andhavana in order to be present at the fulfilment of Rāhula's wish.  This scene was one of the incidents sculptured in the Relic Chamber of the Mahā Thūpa, as was also the ordination of Rāhula.  Mhv.xxxi.81, 83.[/p][p]Afterwards, in the assembly of monks, the Buddha declared Rāhula foremost among those of his disciples who were anxious for training (sikkhākāmānam).  A.i.24; the Vinaya (iii.16) gives a story illustrating Rāhula's extreme conscientiousness in the observance of rules.  He arrived one evening at Kosambī, when the Buddha was staying there in the Badarikārāma.  Rāhula was told there of a new rule which had been laid down to the effect that no novice should sleep under the same roof as a fully ordained monk.  Unable to find any resting place which did not violate this rule, Rāhula spent the night in the Buddha's jakes.  When the Buddha discovered him there the next morning, he modified the rule.  This incident and Rāhula's keenness in observing rules are described again in greater detail at J.i.161f.  There the Buddha is said to have found fault with Sāriputta for his neglect of Rāhula (see also Sp.iv.744).  On another occasion, finding no place in which to sleep because monks who had arrived late had taken his sleeping place, Rāhula spent the night in the open, in front of the Buddha's cell.  Māra, seeing him there, assumed the form of a huge elephant and trumpeted loudly, hoping to frighten him.  But the plot failed.  This was eight years after Rāhula had attained arahantship (DhA.iv.69f.).[/p][p]In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, both Rāhula and Ratthapāla were rich householders of Hamsavatī, who, realizing the vanity of riches, gave all away to the poor.  One day they entertained two ascetics of great power.  The ascetic to whom Rāhula ministered was in the habit of visiting the abode of the Nāga king, Pathavindhara, and had been impressed by its magnificence.  Therefore, in returning thanks to Rāhula for his hospitality, he wished that his host might resemble Pathavindhara.  Rāhula remembered this, and after death he was born in the Nāga world as Pathavindhara, his friend being born as Sakka.  He was, however, dissatisfied with his lot, and one day when, with Virūpakkha, he was on a visit to Sakka, Sakka recognized him, and finding out that he was dissatisfied, suggested to him a remedy.  Pathavindhara invited the Buddha to his abode.  The Buddha, attended by Sumana and one hundred thousand arahants, came and was entertained by him.  In the company of monks was Uparevata, the Buddha's son, seated next to him, and Pathavindhara was so fascinated by him that he could not take his eyes off him.  Discovering who he was, Pathavindhara expressed a wish that he, too, might be born as the son of a future Buddha.  Later, in the time of Kassapa Buddha, Rāhula was born as Pathavindhara, the eldest son of King Kiki, later becoming his viceroy.  His seven sisters built seven residences for the Buddha, and, at their suggestion, Pathavindhara built five hundred residences for the monks.  The story of the past as given here is taken from AA.i.141ff.; part of it is given in MA.ii.722 under Ratthapāla, but the account differs in details.  There the Nāga world is called Bhumindhara, and the Nāga king, Pālita.  SNA.i.341 differs again and calls the king Sankha.  See also ThagA.ii.30 on Ratthapāla, where no mention is made of Rāhula.  The Apadāna (i.  60f.) gives a different version altogether.  There Rāhula gave Padumuttara Buddha a carpet (santhara), as a result of which, twenty one kappas ago, he was born as a khattiya named Vimala, in Renuvatī.  There he lived in a palace, Sudassana, specially built for him by Vissakamma.[/p][p]Four verses uttered by Rāhula are included in the Theragāthā (vs.295 98; Mil.413 contains several other stanzas attributed to Rāhula).[/p][p]It is said that the news of Rāhula's birth was brought to the Bodhisatta when he was enjoying himself in his pleasances on the banks of the royal pond after being decked by Vissakamma.  As soon as the news was announced, he made up his mind to renounce the world without delay, for he saw, in the birth of a son, a new bond attaching him to household life ("Rāhulajāto, bandhanam jātam" the word rāhula meaning bond).  J.i.60; DhA.i.70. The Ap.  Commentary, however, derives Rāhula from Rāhu; just as Rāhu obstructs the moon, so would the child be as obstruction to the Bodhisatta's Renunciation.[/p][p]According to the Dīgha and Samyutta Commentaries (DA.ii.549; SA.iii.172), Rāhula predeceased the Buddha and even Sāriputta, and the place of his death is given as Tāvatimsa.  For twelve years he never lay on a bed.  (DA.iii.736).[/p][p]In numerous Jātakas, Rāhula is mentioned as having been the Bodhisatta's son - e.g., in the Uraga, Kapi (No.  250), Kumbhakāra, Khandahāla, Culla Sutasoma, Daddara, Bandhanāgāra, Makkata, Makhadeva, Mahājanaka, Mahāsudassana, Vidhurapandita, Vessantara, Sīhakotthuka and Sonaka.  He was also Yaññadatta, son of Mandavya (Sāriputta) and the young tortoise in the Mahāukkusa.  The Apadāna (ii.551) says that in many births Uppalavannā and Rāhula were born of the same parents (ekasmim sambhave) and had similar tendencies (samānacchandamānasā).[/p][p]Rāhula was known to his friends as Rāhulabhadda (Rāhula, the Lucky).  He himself says (Thag.  vs.  295f ) that he deserved the title because he was twice blest in being the son of the Buddha and an arahant himself.  Mention is often made in the books (DhA.i.124; MA.i.537; Mil.410 attributes this statement to Sāriputta; SNA.i.202 expands it to include others) that, though Rāhula was his own son, the Buddha showed as much love for Devadatta, Angulimāla and Dhanapāla as he did for Rāhula.[/p][p]Asoka built a thūpa in honour of Rāhula, to be specially worshipped by novices.

They contain mention of qualities which mature emancipation, vimuttiparipācanīyadhammā (SA.ii.159).[/p][hr][h4]1. Rāhula Sutta[/h4][p]The Buddha tells Rāhula that a monk should cultivate the thought that, in the four elements, either in one's own body or in external objects, there is neither self nor what pertains to the self.  A.ii.164; this same topic is discussed in greater detail in the Ambalatthika Rāhulovāda Sutta.[/p][p]Buddhaghosa says (AA.ii.547) that the Buddha here declares catukotikasuññatā (emptiness in the four things i.e., elements).[/p][hr][h4]2. Rāhula Sutta[/h4][p]Rāhula visits the Buddha and asks him how to get rid of the insidious idea of "I" and "mine," both with regard to one's own body and with all external objects.  The Buddha replies that one should see things as they really are, that in none of the five khandhas is there any "I" or "mine." This is right insight.  S.iii.135; this sutta is given at S.ii.252 as Anusaya Sutta.  Buddhaghosa describes both this sutta and the next as Rāhulovāda vipassanā (AA.ii.547).[/p][hr][h4]3.

The Buddha reminds him that he (Rāhula) is a follower of "the torch bearer among men." He has left the world to put an end to sorrow.  He should, therefore, associate with good friends, in good surroundings.  He should be free from attachment to food or clothes.  He should free his mind from all evil tendencies and fill it with thoughts of renunciation.  SN.  vv.  335 42. Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.532, 635) that the purpose of this sutta was to emphasize the value of good association (kalyānamittūpanissaya).[/p]</e>

It is discovered that both are of the same age and power.  Each driver sings the praises of his own master, but then they discover that Mallika is good to the good and bad to the bad, while Brahmadatta is good to both the good and the bad.  Mallika's charioteer acknowledges Brahmadatta as the superior and gives place.[/p][p]The story is related to Pasenadi, who comes to the Buddha after having had to decide a difficult case involving moral turpitude.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Ratthapāla [/div][hr][h4]1. Ratthapāla Thera[/h4][p]Chief of those who had left the world through faith (saddhāpabbajitānam) (A.i.24).  He was born at Thullakotthita in the Kuru country as the son of a very wealthy councillor and was called by his family name of Ratthapāla.  Given to the family because it retrieved the fortunes of a disrupted kingdom, says the Commentary.  He lived in great luxury, and, in due course, married a suitable wife.  When the Buddha visited Thullakotthita, Ratthapāla went to hear him preach and decided to leave the world.  His parents would not, however, give their consent till he threatened to starve himself to death.  Realizing then that he was in earnest, they agreed to let him go on condition that he would visit them after his ordination.  Ratthapāla accompanied the Buddha to Sāvatthi, and there, dwelling alone, he attained arahantship within a short time (But MA.ii.725 says he took twelve years, during which time he never slept on a bed, DA.iii.236).  Then, with the Buddha's permission, he returned to Thullakotthita and dwelt in the deer park of the Kuru king.  The day after his arrival, while begging for alms, he came to his father's house.  His father was in the entrance hall having his hair combed, but, failing to recognize his son, he started to abuse him, taking him for an ordinary monk, one of those who had robbed him of his son.  Just at that moment the slave girl of the house was about to throw away some stale rice, which Ratthapāla begged of her.  The girl recognized his voice, gave him the rice and told his parents who he was.  When his father came to look for his son, he found him eating stale rice as though it were ambrosia.  (This eating of stale rice made of him an aggaariyavamsika, Sp.i.208; MA.ii.726).  Having already finished eating, when invited to enter the house, he would not do so, but on the next day he went again, and his father tried to tempt him by making a display of the immense wealth which would be his should he return to the lay life, while his former wives, beautifully clothed, asked him about the nymphs, for whose sake he led the homeless life.  "For the sake of no nymphs, Sisters," he said, and they fell fainting under the shock of being addressed as "Sisters." Growing impatient at the conduct of his family, he asked for his meal, ate it, preached to them (Buddhaghosa says that according to the Commentators of India, parasamuddavāsītherānām, he preached standing; the stanzas so preached are given in M.i.64f.  and again in Thag.769-75) on the impermanence of all things, the futility of wealth, the snare of beauty, etc., and returned to Migācīra.  Through the air, says the Commentary (ThagA.ii.34; MA.ii.730), because his father put bolts on the house and tried to keep him there.  He also sent men to remove his yellow robes and clothe him in white.[/p][p]There the Kuru king, who was feasting there, and had often heard of Ratthapāla's fame, visited him.  Their conversation is recorded in the Ratthapāla Sutta.  Ratthapāla then returned to the Buddha.  Ratthapāla's story is given in M.ii.54ff.; MA.ii.722; ThagA.ii.30ff.; AA.i.144ff., cp.  Avadas.  ii.118ff.; Mtu.iii.41, n.1.[/p][p]In a previous birth, before the appearance of Padumuttara Buddha, Ratthapāla was one of two rich householders of Hamsavatī, both of whom spent their wealth in good deeds.  They once waited on two companies of ascetics from Himavā; the ascetics left, but their leaders remained, and the two householders looked after them till they died.  After death, one of them (Ratthapāla) was reborn as Sakka, while the other was born as the Nāga king Pālita (v.l.  Pathavindhara), who, in this Buddha age, became Rāhula.  At Sakka's request, Pālita gave alms to Padumuttara and wished to be like the Buddha's son, Uparevata.  Sakka himself entertained the Buddha and his monks for seven days and wished to resemble the monk Ratthapāla, whom Padumuttara Buddha had declared to be foremost among those who had joined the Order through faith.  Padumuttara declared that the wish of both would be fulfilled in the time of Gotama Buddha.[/p][p]MA.ii.722; ThagA.ii.30 differs in many details; it makes no mention of Pālita, and says that in Padumuttara's time, too, the householder's name was Ratthapāla.  The name of the monk, disciple of Padumuttara, whose example incited the householder to wish for similar honour, is not given.  This account adds (see also AA.i.143f.) that in the time of Phussa Buddha (q.v.) he was one of those in charge of the almsgiving held in the Buddha's honour by his three step brothers.  Bimbisāra and Visākha were his colleagues (AA.i.165).  The Ap.i.63f is again different.  It says that in Padumuttara's time the householder gave the Buddha an elephant with all its trappings, and then, buying it back, built with the money a sanghā-rāma containing fifty four thousand rooms.  As a result he was king of the gods fifty times and Cakkavatti fifty eight times.  AA.i.141 gives the story at greater length, some of the minor details varying.[/p][p]Ratthapāla is mentioned (E.g., SNA.i.232; at AA.ii.596 Yasa's name is added ) with Sona-setthiputta as one who enjoyed great luxury as a householder.  He is an example (DA.ii.642; SA.iii.201; VibhA.306; DhA.iv.195) of one who attained to the higher knowledge through resolution (chandam dhuram katvā).  The Vinayapitaka (Vin.iii.148; Ratthapāla is here called a kulaputta.  The incident probably refers to his lay life) contains a stanza quoted by the Buddha, in which Ratthapāla's father enquires of his son why the latter never asked him for anything.  "Because begging is a degrading thing," says Ratthapāla.[/p][hr][p][b]2. Ratthapāla.[/b] A monk in the time of Padumuttara Buddha.

It contains an account of Ratthapāla's admission into the Order, his visits to his parents after attaining arahantship, and his conversation with the Kuru king in the latter's Deer Park.  This last conversation forms the chief theme.  The king asks Ratthapāla why he has left his home when he suffers neither from old age, failing health, poverty, nor death of kinsfolk.  Ratthapāla answers that his reason for leaving it was his conviction of the truth of the four propositions enunciated by the Buddha that the world (1) is in a state of continual flux and change; (2) there is no protector or preserver; (3) in it, we own nothing, but must leave all behind us; (4) it lacks and bankers, being enslaved by craving.  These four propositions are referred to as Cattāro dhammuddesā (MA.i.361).[/p][p]He explains the meaning of these statements to the satisfaction of the king and summarizes his statements in a series of stanzas.

[/p][blockquote][p]* E.g., Bu.xxvi.15; Mhv.ii.24 calls her Bhaddakaccānā; but see Thomas, op.  cit., 49; she is also called Subhaddakā, this being probably a variant of Bhaddakaccānā.[/p][/blockquote][p]The Northern texts seem to favour the name of Yasodharā, but they call her the daughter of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dandapaanii,Dandapānī')"]Dandapānī[/a].  (See also Rockhill, op.  cit., where various other names are given as well).  It is probable that the name of Gotama's wife was Bimbā, and that Bhaddakaccā, Subhaddakā, Yosadhāri and the others, were descriptive epithets applied to her, which later became regarded as, additional names.  It is also possible that in Gotama's court there was also a Yasodharā, daughter of Dandapānī, and that there was a later confusion of names.  The Commentarial explanation (E.g., AA.i.204), that she was called Bhaddakaccānā because her body was the colour of burnished gold, is probably correct.  To suggest (E.g., Thomas, op.  cit., 49) that the name bears any reference to the Kaccānagotta seems to be wrong, because the Kaccāna was a brahmin gotta and the Sākiyans were not brahmins.[/p][p]Rāhulamātā was born on the same day as the Bodhisatta (J.i.54; BuA.  106, 228).  She married him (Gotama) at the age of sixteen (the following account is taken chiefly from J.i.58ff), and was placed at the head of forty thousand women, given to Gotama by the Sākiyans, after he had proved his manly prowess to their satisfaction.  Gotama left the household life on the day of the birth of his son Rāhula (according to one account, referred to in the Jātaka Commentary, i.62, Rāhula was seven days old).  It is said that just before he left home he took a last look at his wife from the door of her room, not daring to go nearer, lest he should awake her.  When the Buddha paid his first visit to Kapilavatthu after the Enlightenment, and on the second day of that visit, he begged in the street for alms.  This news spread, and Rāhulamātā looked out of her window to see if it were true.  She saw the Buddha, and was so struck by the glory of his personality that she uttered eight verses in its praise.  These verses have been handed down under the name of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/narasihagata,Narasīhagāthā')"]Narasīhagāthā[/a]; on that day, after the Buddha had finished his meal in the palace, which he took at the invitation of Suddhodana, all the ladies of the court, with the exception of Rāhulamātā, went to pay him obeisance.  She refused to go, saying that if she had any virtue in her the Buddha would come to her.  The Buddha went to her with his two chief Disciples and gave orders that she should be allowed to greet him as she wished.  She fell at his feet, and clasping them with her hands, put her head on them.  Suddhodana related to the Buddha how, from the time he had left home, Rāhulamātā had herself abandoned all luxury and had lived in the same manner as she had heard that the Buddha lived - wearing yellow robes, eating only once a day, etc.  And the Buddha then related the [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/candakinnara_jat_485,Candakinnara Jātaka')"]Candakinnara Jātaka[/a], to show how, in the past, too, her loyalty had been supreme.[/p][p]On the seventh day of the Buddha's visit, when he left the palace at the end of his meal, Rāhulamātā sent Rāhula to him saying, "That is your father, go and ask him for your inheritance." Rāhula followed the Buddha, and, at the Buddha's request, was ordained by Sāriputta.

The Apadāna account (vvs.  1ff ) mentions how, just before her death, at the age of seventy eight, she took leave of the Buddha and performed various miracles.

Rāhula reported the matter to his preceptor, Sāriputta, who obtained the mango juice from Pasenadi.  When Pasenadi discovered why the mango juice had been needed, he arranged that from that day it should be regularly supplied.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Rāhu[/div][p]An Asura chieftain (Asurinda) (cp.  Mtu.iii.138, 254).  The Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.49f) says that on one occasion when he seized Candimā (Moon god), and on another Suriya (Sun god), both these invoked the aid of the Buddha.  The Buddha then instructed Rāhu to let them free.  Rāhu immediately let them go and ran to Vepacitti, "trembling and with stiffened hair." This incident evidently refers to the Indian myth of the eclipses, and the legend has been annexed by the Buddhists to illustrate the Buddha's power and pity.[/p][p]Elsewhere (A.ii.17) Rāhu is spoken of as the chief of those possessing personality (attabhāva).  The Commentaries (E.g., AA.ii.474; DA.ii.487f.; MA.ii.790; SA.i.86, contains more details and differs slightly) explain that he is four thousand eight hundred leagues in height, and that the breadth of his chest is one thousand two hundred yojanas.  His hands and feet are two hundred leagues long, each finger joint measuring fifty leagues, the space between the eyebrows also measuring fifty leagues.  His forehead is fifty leagues broad, and his head nine hundred leagues in height.  His face measures one hundred leagues, his nose three hundred, and the depth of his mouth one hundred.  He is jealous of the gods of the Sun and the Moon, and stands in their paths with wide open mouth.  When they fall into his mouth, the gods abandon their abodes and flee for their lives.  Sometimes he caresses their abodes with his hand only, or with the lower part of his jaw, or with his tongue.  Sometimes he takes them up and places them against his cheek; but he cannot stop the course of either the Sun or the Moon; if he attempts to do so, he will meet with disaster.  So he journeys along with them.[/p][p]The seizure of the Moon by Rāhu and the escape from him is often used as a simile (E.g., SN.  vs.  465; J.i.183, 274; iii.364, 377; iv.330; v.453; DhA.iv.19, etc.).  Rāhu is one of the four "stains" (upakkilesā) of the Sun and the Moon, preventing them from shining in all their glory (A.ii.53; Vin.ii.295; cp.  J.iii.365).  He is further mentioned as one of the five causes of lack of rain (vassassa antarāya).  When he gathers water into his hands and spills it into the ocean, there is no rain (A.iii.243).  The idea seems to be that he gathers up the rain water which is in the sky in order to cool his body.[/p][p]To bring Rāhu down from the sky is mentioned as one of the impossible tasks (J.iii.477).[/p][p]It is said (DA.i.285; MA.ii.790f ) that for a long time Rāhu did not visit the Buddha, he thought that being so tall he would fail to see the Buddha.  One day, however, he decided to go, and the Buddha, aware of his intention, lay on a bed when he arrived, and, by his iddhi power, contrived to make himself so tall that Rāhu had to crane his neck to see his face.  Rāhu, thereupon, confessed his folly and accepted the Buddha as his teacher.[/p][p]Rāhu is mentioned (D.ii.259) as being among the Asuras who were present at the Mahāsmaya and as blessing that assembly.  In this context he is called Rāhubhadda.  When Rāhu steps into the ocean, the water of the deepest part reaches only to his knees (DA.ii.488).  Rāhu is also called Veroca, and Bāli's hundred sons were called after him, he being their uncle (DA.ii.689).  The name Rāhumukha is given to a form of torture (E.g., M.i.87; iii.164; Nid.154; Mil.197, 358), in which the victim's mouth is forced open by a stake and fire or spikes are sent through the orifice of the ear into the mouth, which becomes filled with blood (AA.i.293).[/p]</e>

When the northern parts of the island were in the hands of foreigners or usurpers, the Singhalese court, its nobles and loyalists, often sought refuge in Rohana.  It seems, for the most part, to have been very little controlled from the capital, and many rebellions against the ruler of the capital originated in Rohana.  See Dutthagāmani and Vijayabāhu; also, e.g., Mhv.xxiii.13; xxxiii.37; xxxv.27f., 67, 125; Cv.xxxviii.12, 39; xli.89ff.; xliv.54; xlviii.59, etc.  [/p][p]In times of persecution and scarcity the Buddhist monks found patronage and shelter among the inhabitants of Rohana (E.g., Mhv.xxxvii.6).

As punishment for this, he was charged with the task of persuading Nāgasena to join the Order.  To achieve this purpose, Rohana had to visit the house of Nāgasena's father, Sonuttara, during seven years and ten months, without ever receiving even a kind word, till, at last, one day Sonuttara was pleased with his kindness and courtesy and gave him food daily at the house.  When Nāgasena grew up and learnt the Vedas, Rohana engaged him in discussion, as a result of which Nāgasena joined the Order under Rohana, who, as his first preceptor, taught him the Abhidhamma.  One day, Nāgasena thought lightly of his teacher, and Rohana, reading his thoughts, chided him.

[/p][p]It is said that when the Buddha saw Rādha he felt the inclination to talk on matters dealing with subtle topics, illustrating them with various similes.

If the reference is to this same thera, Rādha was, for some time, the attendant (pacchāsamana) of Sāriputta, and there is a verse in Thag.  (993) spoken to him by Sāriputta, who was pleased with Rādha's gentle manner.  DhA.ii.104ff.  gives more details of the ordination of Rādha.  There we are told that he went to the monastery where he performed various duties.  But the monks would not admit him into the Order, and, owing to his disappointment, he grew thin.  One day the Buddha, seeing him with his divine eye, went to him, and hearing of his wish to join the Order, summoned the monks and asked if any of them remembered any favour done by Rādha.  Sāriputta mentioned that he had once received a ladleful of Rādha's own food while begging in Rājagaha.  The Buddha then suggested that Sāriputta should listen to Rādha's request for ordination.  After ordination, Rādha grew weary of the food of the refectory, but Sāriputta constantly admonished him and found him most humble; later, he spoke highly of Rādha's obedience, and the Buddha praised him.  It was on Rādha's account that the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/aliinacitta_jat_156,Alīnacitta Jātaka')"]Alīnacitta Jātaka[/a] was preached.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Rakkha[/div][hr][h4]1. Rakkha[/h4][p]A general of Parakkamabāhu I.  He was originally the Dandādhināyaka (? general) of Gajabāhu, but Parakkamabāhu won him over and put him in charge of the conquest of the Malaya country.  He accomplished this with the help of his younger brother, after fighting many battles and subduing the chiefs of the various districts (Cv.lxx.5ff).  The king thereupon conferred on him the rank of Kesadhātu.  Later, he subdued the district of Merukandara and was sent against the Mahālekha Mahinda, whom he defeated at Sarogāmatittha.  He was associated with Nagaragiri Nātha in the fight against Mānābharana near Badaravallī.  After this he is referred to as Adhikārī Rakkha, and the war against Mānābharana seems to have been chiefly in his charge.  He was in command of the army at Mangalabegāma and Mihiranabibbila, and decisively defeated Mānābharana's general, Buddhanāyaka at Rajatakedāra.  Later, when Queen Sugalā raised a revolt in Rohana, it was Rakkha who was sent to crush it.  He was by now commander in chief, and was helped in the subjugation of Rohana by the general Bhūta.  They fought a battle at Lokagalla and advanced to Majjhimagāma and occupied Uddhanadvāra, where Rakkha was helped by the two Kittis, the Adhikāri and the Jīvapotthakī.  From there they marched to Mahārīvara, and at Badaguna crushed Sugalā's forces, thus gaining possession of the Sacred Bowl and the Sacred Tooth which these forces were carrying.  In a last onslaught at Dematavala, Rakkha put the enemy to flight and marched on to Sappanārukokilla, where he died of an attack of dysentery.  Cv.lxx.  5, 15, 19, 282, 295; lxxii.2ff., 107, 160, 207, 232, 265ff.; lxxiv.  41ff.  55, 72ff., 111ff., 136ff.[/p][hr][h4]2. Rakkha[/h4][p]called Lankādhinātha.  A general of Parakkamabāhu I.  He helped Lokajitvāna to defeat Hukitti, and was later sent to Janapada to fight against Gajabāhu's forces.  He was successful, and occupied Yagālla and Talātthala.  Gajabāhu tried to win him over with bribes, but Rakkha mutilated the envoys and sent the presents to Parakkamabāhu.  He fought at Aligāma against Gajabāhu's general, Sīka, and, proving victorious, held a great celebration.  Later he was in charge of the successful attack on Pulatthipura, when the city was captured and Gajabāhu taken prisoner.  He was then sent to Mangalabegāma against Mānābharana, and fought so fiercely that the latter was forced to flee to Rohana.  Rakkha was placed in charge of the ford at Nigundivālukā.  He was, however, greatly offended by the favour shown by Parakkamabāhu to his rival, the Senāpati Deva, and no longer showed himself zealous in war.  An officer of Gajabāhu who was with Rakkha, noticing this, sent word to Mānābharana to come at once and take advantage of Rakkha's lethargy.  Mānābharana followed this advice and advanced against Rakkha, whom he killed in the course of a fierce battle.  Cv.lxx.  24, 98ff., 115ff., 174, 232, 283, 297, 306; lxxii.37, 75ff.[/p][hr][h4]3. Rakkha[/h4][p]called Mahālekha.  He was an officer of Parakkamabāhu I.  and took part in the campaigns against Mānābharana, being stationed at Mangalabegāma, at Pillavitthi.  At this place he fought a battle, which lasted for eight days, against Buddhanāyaka and Mahāmāladeva, and brought the district of Kālavāpi under his power.  Cv.lxxii.161, 170ff., 182, 206.[/p][hr][h4]4. Rakkha[/h4][p]called Damilādhikāri.  He was an officer of Parakkamabāhu I., and was one of those chiefly responsible for the subjugation of Rohana.  He fought battles at Donivagga, Guralatthakalañcha, Pūgadandakāvāta, Bodhiāvāta, Bhinnālavanāgāma and several other places, and inflicted severe defeats on the rebel forces, dealing them a severe blow at Mahāsenagāma, where Lankāpura Rakkha was killed.  This enabled him to take possession of Mahānāgahula.  In order to bring the province completely under his control he had to fight further at Bakagalla Uddhavāpi, Sanghabhedakagāma, Kuravakagalla and Mahāpabbata, and he thus won full possession of Dvādasasahassaka, where he seems to have spent the rest of his days.

He had a brother, Cittamiga, and a sister Sutanā.  One day Khemā, wife of the king of Benares, dreamed that a golden deer preached to her and begged the king to make the dream come true.  The king offered great rewards, and a hunter, who was aware of Rohanta's existence, undertook to bring him to the court.  He set a trap in the ford where the deer drank and Rohanta was caught in it.  When Rohanta gave the alarm, all the deer fled except Cittamiga and Sutanā.  They told the hunter that they would die with their brother rather than leave him, and the hunter, touched by their devotion, set Rohanta free.  When Rohanta discovered why he had been caught, he offered to go to Benares, but was dissuaded by the hunter owing to the risks he would run.  Rohanta then taught the Law to the hunter and sent him back with a golden hair from his body.  The hunter related the story to the king and queen and preached to them the Law.  Then rejecting the rewards they offered him, he became an ascetic in the Himālaya.[/p][p]The story was related in reference to Ananda's attempt to throw himself before the elephant Dhanapāla, who was sent to kill the Buddha.

She wished to keep at least the youngest of the boys, Revata, for herself, and had him married at the age of seven, but her plot miscarried (See Revata).  This embittered her against the monks, and, though she gave them alms when they came to the house, she blamed them for having enticed her children away.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Rājagaha[/div][p]A city, the capital of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/magadha,Magadha')"]Magadha[/a].  There seem to have been two distinct towns; the older one, a hill fortress, more properly called Giribbaja, was very ancient and is said (VvA.  p.82; but cp.  D.ii.235, where seven cities are attributed to his foundation) to have been laid out by Mahāgovinda, a skilled architect.  The later town, at the foot of the hills, was evidently built by  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bimbisara,Bimbisāra')"]Bimbisāra[/a].  [/p][p] [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hiuen_tsang,Hiouen Thsang')"]Hiouen Thsang[/a] says (Beal, ii.145) that the old capital occupied by  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bimbisara,Bimbisāra')"]Bimbisāra[/a] was called Kusāgra.  It was afflicted by frequent fires, and Bimbisāra, on the advice of his ministers, abandoned it and built the new city on the site of the old cemetery.  The building of this city was hastened on by a threatened invasion by the king of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vesaali,Vesāli')"]Vesāli[/a].  The city was called Rājagaha because Bimbisāra was the first person to occupy it.  Both Hiouen Thsang and Fa Hsien (Giles: 49) record another tradition which ascribed the foundation of the new city to  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajatasattu,Ajātasattu')"]Ajātasattu[/a].[/p][p]Pargiter (Ancient Ind.  Historical Tradition, p.149) suggests that the old city was called Kusāgrapura, after Kusāgra, an early king of Magadha.  In the Rāmāyana (i.  7, 32) the city is called Vasumatī.  The Mahābhārata gives other names - Bārhadrathapura (ii.24, 44), Varāha, Vrsabha, Rsigiri, Caityaka (see PHAI.,p.70).  [/p][p]It was also called Bimbisārapurī and Magadhapura (SNA.ii.584).[/p][p]But both names were used indiscriminately (E.g., S.N.  vs.  405), though Giribbaja seems, as a name, to have been restricted to verse passages.  The place was called Giribbaja (mountain stronghold) because it was surrounded by five hills - Pandava, Gijjhakūta, Vebhāra, Isigili and Vepulla* - and Rājagaha, because it was the seat of many kings, such as Mandhātā and Mahāgovinda (SNA.ii.413).  It would appear, from the names given of the kings, that the city was a very ancient royal capital.  In the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vidhurapandita_jat_545,Vidhurapandita Jātaka')"]Vidhurapandita Jātaka[/a] (J.vi.271), Rājagaha is called the capital of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anga,Anga')"]Anga[/a].  This evidently refers to a time when Anga had subjugated Magadha.  [/p][blockquote][p]* SNA.ii.382; it is said (M.iii.68) that these hills, with the exception of Isigili, were once known by other names e.g., Vankaka for Vepulla (S.ii.191).

The country to the north of the hills was known as Dakkhināgiri (SA.i.188).[/p][p]Rājagaha was closely associated with the Buddha's work.  He visited it soon after the Renunciation, journeying there on foot from the River Anomā, a distance of thirty leagues (J.i.66).  Bimbisāra saw him begging in the street, and, having discovered his identity and the purpose of his quest, obtained from him a promise of a visit to Rājagaha as soon as his aim should be achieved (See the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pabbajja_sutta,Pabbajjā Sutta')"]Pabbajjā Sutta[/a] and its Commentary).  During the first year after the Enlightenment therefore, the Buddha went to Rājagaha from [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gayaa,Gayā')"]Gayā[/a], after the conversion of the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uruvela_kassapa,Tebhātika Jatilas')"]Tebhātika Jatilas[/a].   [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bimbisara,Bimbisāra')"]Bimbisāra[/a] and his subjects gave the Buddha a great welcome, and the king entertained him and a large following of monks in the palace.  It is said that on the day of the Buddha's entry into the royal quarters,  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka,Sakka')"]Sakka[/a] led the procession, in the guise of a young man, singing songs of praise of the Buddha.  It was during this visit that Bimbisāra gifted  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/veluvana,Veluvana')"]Veluvana[/a] to the Order and that the Buddha received  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta,Sāriputta')"]Sāriputta[/a] and  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_moggallana_th,Moggallāna')"]Moggallāna[/a] as his disciples.  (Details of this visit are given in Vin.i.35ff ).  Large numbers of householders joined the Order, and people blamed the Buddha for breaking up their families.  But their censure lasted for only seven days.  Among those ordained were the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/s5_say,Sattarasavaggiyā')"]Sattarasavaggiyā[/a] with  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/upaali,Upāli')"]Upāli[/a] at their head.  [/p][p]The Buddha spent his first vassa in Rājagaha and remained there during the winter and the following summer.  The people grew tired of seeing the monks everywhere, and, on coming to know of their displeasure, the Buddha went first to  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dakkhinaagiri,Dakkhināgiri')"]Dakkhināgiri[/a] and then to  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapilavatthu,Kapilavatthu')"]Kapilavatthu[/a] (Vin.i.77ff).  [/p][p]According to the Buddhavamsa Commentary (p.13), the Buddha spent also in Rājagaha the third, fourth, seventeenth and twentieth vassa.  After the twentieth year of his teaching, he made  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi,Sāvatthi')"]Sāvatthi[/a] his headquarters, though he seems frequently to have visited and stayed at Rājagaha.

Just before his death, the Buddha paid a last visit there.  At that time, Ajātasattu was contemplating an attack on the Vajjians, and sent his minister,  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vassakaara,Vassakāra')"]Vassakāra[/a], to the Buddha at Gijjhakūta, to find out what his chances of success were (D.ii.72).[/p][p]After the Buddha's death, Rājagaha was chosen by the monks, with  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kassapa_th,Mahā Kassapa')"]Mahā Kassapa[/a] at their head, as the meeting place of the First Convocation.  This took place at the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sattapanniguha,Sattapanniguhā')"]Sattapanniguhā[/a], and  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajatasattu,Ajātasattu')"]Ajātasattu[/a] extended to the undertaking his whole hearted patronage (Vin.ii.285; Sp.i.7f.; DA.i.8f., etc.).  The king also erected at Rājagaha a cairn over the relics of the Buddha, which he had obtained as his share (D.ii.166).  According to the Mahā Vamsa, (Mhv.xxxi.21; MT.  564) some time later, acting on the suggestion of Mahā Kassapa, the king gathered at Rājagaha seven donas of the Buddha's relics which had been deposited in various places - excepting those deposited at Rāmagāma - and built over them a large thūpa.  It was from there that Asoka obtained relics for his vihāras.[/p][p]Rājagaha was one of the six chief cities of the Buddha's time, and as such, various important trade routes passed through it.  The others cities were  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/campaa,Campā')"]Campā[/a],  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi,Sāvatthi')"]Sāvatthi[/a],  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saketa,Sāketa')"]Sāketa[/a],  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambii,Kosambī')"]Kosambī[/a] and  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"]Benares[/a] (D.ii.147).[/p][p]The road from  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/takkasilaa,Takkasilā')"]Takkasilā[/a] to Rājagaha was one hundred and ninety two leagues long and passed through Sāvatthi, which was forty five leagues from Rājagaha.

[/p][p]From Rājagaha to the Ganges was a distance of five leagues, and when the Buddha visited Vesāli at the invitation of the Licchavis, the kings on either side of the river vied with each other to show him honour.  DhA.iii.439f.; also Mtu.i.253ff.; according to Dvy.  (p.55) the Ganges had to be crossed between Rājagaha and Sāvatthi, as well, by boat, some of the boats belonging to the king of Magadha and others to the Licchavis of Vesāli.[/p][p]The distance between Rājagaha and Nālandā is given as one league, and the Buddha often walked between the two (DA.i.35).[/p][p]The books mention various places besides Veluvana, with its Kalandaka-nivāpa vihāra in and around Rājagaha - e.g., Sītavana, Jīvaka's Ambavana, Pipphaliguhā, Udumbarikārāma, Moranivāpa with its Paribbājakārāma, Tapodārāma, Indasālaguhā in Vediyagiri, Sattapanniguhā, Latthivana, Maddakucchi, Supatitthacetiya, Pāsānakacetiya, Sappasondikapabbhāra and the pond Sumāgadhā.[/p][p]At the time of the Buddha's death, there were eighteen large monasteries in Rājagaha (Sp.i.9).  Close to the city flowed the rivers Tapodā and Sappinī.  In the city was a Potter's Hall where travelers from far distances spent the night.  E.g., Pukkusāti (MA.ii.987); it had also a Town Hall (J.iv.72).  The city gates were closed every evening, and after that it was impossible to enter the city.  Vin.iv.116f.; the city had thirty-two main gates and sixty four smaller entrances (DA.i.150; MA.ii.795).  One of the gates of Rājagaha was called Tandulapāla (M.ii.185).  Round Rājagaha was a great peta world (MA.ii.960; SA.i.31).[/p][p]In the Buddha's time there was constant fear of invasion by the Licchavis, and Vassakāra (q.v.) is mentioned as having strengthened its fortifications.  To the north east of the city were the brahmin villages of Ambasandā (D.ii.263) and Sālindiyā (J.iii.293); other villages are mentioned in the neighborhood, such as Kītāgiri, Upatissagāma, Kolitagāma, Andhakavinda, Sakkhara and Codanāvatthu (q.v.).  In the Buddha's time, Rājagaha had a population of eighteen crores, nine in the city and nine outside, and the sanitary conditions were not of the best.  SA.i.241; DhA.ii.43; it was because of the city's prosperity that the Mettiya-Bhummajakas made it their headquarters (Sp.iii.614).  The city was not free from plague (DhA.i.232).  [/p][p]The Treasurer of Rājagaha and Anāthapindika had married each other's sisters, and it was while Anāthapindika (q.v.) was on a visit to Rājagaha that he first met the Buddha.[/p][p]The people of Rājagaha, like those of most ancient cities, held regular festivals; one of the best known of these was the Giraggasamajjā (q.v.).  Mention is also made of troupes of players visiting the city and giving their entertainments for a week on end.  (See, e.g., the story of Uggasena).[/p][p]Soon after the death of the Buddha, Rājagaha declined both in importance and prosperity.  Sisunāga transferred the capital to Vesāli, and Kālāsoka removed it again to Pātaliputta, which, even in the Buddha's time, was regarded as a place of strategically importance.  When Hiouen Thsang visited Rājagaha, he found it occupied by brahmins and in a very dilapidated condition (Beal, op.  cit., ii.167).  For a long time, however, it seems to have continued as a center of Buddhist activity, and among those mentioned as having been present at the foundation of the Mahā Thūpa were eighty thousand monks led by Indagutta.

It was preached at Vesāli, on the occasion of the Buddha's visit there at the invitation of the Licchavis, who begged him to rid the city of the various dangers which had fallen upon it.  According to the Commentaries (SNA.i.278ff.; DhA.iii.436ff.; KhpA.164f), the Buddha first taught the sutta to Ananda and asked him to go round the city, accompanied by the Licchavi princes, reciting the sutta and sprinkling water from the Buddha's bowl.  Immediately all the evil spirits fled from the city and the people recovered from their diseases.  They then gathered at the Mote hall with various offerings and thither they conducted the Buddha.  In the assembly were present not only all the inhabitants of Vesāli, but also the devas of two deva worlds, with Sakka at their head.  The Buddha preached the Ratana Sutta to this great crowd.  Another account, quoted by Buddhaghosa (DhA.iii.165), says that in the assembly the Buddha preached only the first five stanzas, the rest having been earlier recited by Ananda.  Because this sutta was first preached to ward off the evil from Vesāli, it became the most famous of Buddhist Ward runes (Parittā)[/p][p]The sutta consists of seventeen verses: the first two contain a request to the devas to receive the homage and offerings of men and protect them in their danger; then follow twelve verses, descriptive of the virtues of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha.  It ends with three verses purporting (DhA.iii.195) to have been spoken by Sakka on behalf of all the devas, expressing their adoration of the Buddha, his Dhamma and his Sangha.  It is also said (DhA.iii.196) that during this visit the Buddha stayed at Vesāli for two weeks, preaching the sutta on seven consecutive days; on each day eighty four thousand beings realized the Truth.  The Sutta seems also to have been known as the Gangārohana Sutta (Cv.xxxvii.191).  When Ceylon was troubled by famine and plague in the reign of Upatissa II., the king had the sutta preached by monks while walking in the streets of the city.  All troubles vanished, and he decreed that his successors should do likewise in times of need(Cv.xxxvii.195f).  Sena II.  had the whole sutta inscribed on a golden plate and held a great festival in its honour (Cv.li.79).[/p][p]The sutta is given in the Mahāvastu (i.290ff), where it is described as Svastyanagāthā.[/p][hr][h4]2.

Ruhaka's wife was a foolish old woman who, on hearing of the people's praise, declared that their excitement was due, not to the qualities of the animal, but to its trappings, and that if Ruhaka would go out wearing the horse's trappings, he would be similarly applauded.  Ruhaka agreed to the suggestion and suffered great humiliation; he went home in anger, determined to punish his wife, but she had escaped and had sought the king's protection.  The king persuaded Ruhaka to forgive her because “all womankind is full of faults." (J.ii.113ff )[/p][p]The occasion for the story is given in the Indriya Jātaka (No.  423) (q.v.).[/p]</e>

She consented to do this, sold her jewels, and erected a hall of two stories, the building of which was supervised by Anuruddha.  At the dedication ceremony she entertained the Buddha and the monks.  At the conclusion of the meal the Buddha sent for her.  She was reluctant to go to him owing to her disease, but was persuaded, and he told her the story of her past.[/p][p]Long ago she had been the chief consort of the king of Benares, and being jealous of a dancing girl whom the king loved, she contrived to get powdered scabs on the girl's body, clothes and bed.

After death, Rohinī was born in Tāvatimsa, at the meeting point of the boundaries of four deities.  Because of her beauty, each deity claimed her as his, and they referred their quarrel to Sakka.

A battle was imminent, when the Buddha, seeing what was about to happen, appeared in the air between the opposing forces in the middle of the river and convinced them of the folly of killing each other for the sake of a little water.  It is said that he preached on this occasion the Attadanda Sutta and the Phandana, the Latukika and the Vattaka Jātakas.[/p][p]To show their gratitude to the Buddha for his timely intervention, the Sākyans and the Koliyans gave two hundred and fifty young men from each tribe to be ordained under him.

For six thousand years he lived in the household and then renounced the world, travelling in a chariot, leaving his wife Sudassanā and their son Varuna.  The three palaces occupied by him in his lay life were Sudassana, Ratanagghi and Āvela.

His first sermon was preached at Varunārāma.  [/p][p]The Bodhisatta was a brahmin of Rammavatī, named Atideva, who, seeing the Buddha, spoke his praises in one thousand verses.  Among the Buddha's converts was King Arindama of Uttaranagara.  The Buddha's chief disciples were Varuna and Brahmadeva among monks and Bhaddā and Subhaddā among nuns.  His constant attendant was Sambhava.  His chief lay patrons were Paduma and Kuñjara, and Sirimā and Yasavatī.

Revata [/b] (called [b] [a name="Khadiravaniya"]Khadiravaniya[/a][/b]).  An arahant Thera.  An eminent disciple of the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"]Buddha[/a], declared by him foremost among forest dwellers (araññakānam) (A.i.24).  He was the youngest brother of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta,Sāriputta')"]Sāriputta[/a], and a marriage was arranged for him by his mother who was miserable at seeing her children desert her one after another to join the Order, and wished to keep the youngest at home.  He was only seven years old, and, on the wedding day, the relations of both bride and bridegroom showered blessings on the couple and said to the bride: "May you live as long as your grandmother." Revata asked to see the grandmother, and was shown a woman of one hundred and twenty, decrepit, and showing all the signs of advanced old age.  Realizing that his wife would probably share the same fate, he left the bridal procession on some pretext on the way home, and ran away to a place where some monks lived.  Sāriputta, foreseeing this, had instructed the monks to ordain his brother without reference to his parents, and, when Revata revealed his identity, the monks at once admitted him into the Order.[/p][p]When Sāriputta heard this, he wished to visit his brother, but was persuaded by the Buddha to wait.  Revata, after waiting a long time for the visit from Sāriputta, obtained from his teachers a formula of meditation and himself set out to see the Buddha.  On the way he stopped at a khadiravana (acacia forest) during the rainy season and there won arahantship.[/p][p]At the end of the rains the Buddha, accompanied by Sāriputta and  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda,Ananda')"]Ananda[/a], with five hundred other monks, started out to visit Revata.[/p][p]There were two routes leading to the khadiravana, of which the shorter was thirty leagues long, straight, but infested with evil spirits.  This the Buddha chose because  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/siivalii,Sīvalī Thera')"]Sīvalī Thera[/a] was in the company of monks, and the Buddha knew that the deities of the forest would provide the monks with all they needed because of Sīvalī's presence.  When Revata knew that the Buddha was approaching, he created, by his magic power, splendid dwellings for him and his monks.  The Buddha spent two months in the forest and then returned to the Pubbārāma in  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi,Sāvatthi')"]Sāvatthi[/a].  There he found that  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/visaakhaa,Visākhā')"]Visākhā[/a] had heard contradictory accounts of the dwelling erected by Revata for the monks who had accompanied the Buddha.  He dispelled Visākhā's doubts and spoke of Revata's powers.  DhA.ii.188ff.; it was on this occasion that the Buddha related the story of Sivalī's past; see also DhA.iv.186f.  [/p][p]One of the stanzas (No.  212), of the Muni Sutta was also preached to the monks, according to Buddhaghosa (SNA.i.261f.), in connection with Revata.  This was immediately after the Buddha's talk to Visākhā, mentioned above.  The story of Revata's ordination is also given at AA.i.126ff., with some variations in detail.  The account given in ThagA.i.108ff.  is much shorter; no mention is made of the Buddha's visit to the khadiravana.  Here it is said that, after winning arahantship, Revata went to Sāvatthi to greet the Buddha and Sāriputta.[/p][p]Some time after, Revata returned to his native village and brought away with him his three nephews, sons of his three sisters,  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/caalaa,Cālā')"]Cālā[/a],  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/upacaalaa,Upacālā')"]Upacālā[/a] and  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sisupacala_theri,Sisūpacālā')"]Sisūpacālā[/a].  Sāriputta heard of this and went to see Revata.  Revata knowing that he was coming, exhorted his nephews to be particularly heedful, and Sāriputta expressed his pleasure at their behaviour.  ThagA.i.110; his admonitory verse is given at Thag.vs.43; two verses uttered by Sāriputta in praise of Revata are given at Thag.vss.991-2.[/p][p]The ThagA.i.551f mentions another incident which took place during Revata's old age.  He was in the habit of visiting the Buddha and Sāriputta from time to time after returning to his home in the khadiravana.  Once, during a visit to Sāvatthi, he stayed in a forest near the city.  The police, on the track of some thieves, came upon him, and, finding him near the booty which the thieves had dropped in their flight, arrested him and brought him before the king.  When the king questioned him, the Elder spoke a series of verses (Thag.646 58; Mrs.  Rhys Davids speaks of Revata as a teacher of the Jain doctrine of ahimsā, Gotama the Man, p.116), demonstrating the impossibility of his committing such an act, and also by way of teaching the king the Dhamma.  It is said (ThagA.l.555) that at the conclusion of the stanzas he sat cross legged in the sky until his body burnt itself out.[/p][p]Revata loved solitude, and, on one occasion (DhA.iii.325f), a lay disciple named Atula, hearing that he was in Sāvatthi, went with five hundred others to hear him preach.  But Revata said that he delighted in solitude and refused to address them, and Atula went away complaining.[/p][p]Revata's delight in solitude was sometimes misunderstood.  For instance, the Elder Sanunñjani went about continually sweeping, and, seeing Revata sitting cross legged, thought him an idler.  Revata read his thoughts and admonished him.[/p][p]In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Revata was a boatman at Payāga on the Ganges, and once took the Buddha and his thousand followers across the river in a boat decked with canopies, flowers, etc.  On that occasion he heard the Buddha declare one of the monks highest among forest dwellers, and wished for a similar honour for himself under a future Buddha (ThagA.i.108; A.A.i.126).  Later, he was born in deva worlds.  Fifty eight kappas ago he was a king named Tārana, and a kappa later another king named Campaka.  Ap.i.51f.[/p][hr][p][b] [a name="4"]4[/a].  Revata.

During the conversation, Sānavāsī arrived and questioned Sabbakāmī regarding the Ten Points, but the latter refused to express an opinion in private.  On Revata's suggestion a jury of eight, four from either side, was appointed to go into the question.  Revata himself was a member of this jury, and he it was who questioned Sabbakāmī during the meeting, held in Vālikārāma, regarding the Ten Points.  All the Ten Points were declared to be wrong, and, at the end of the questions, seven hundred monks - chosen from one hundred and twelve thousand, at the head of whom was Revata - held a recital of the Dhamma, which recital therefore came to be called Sattasatī ("Seven Hundred").

[/p][p]The kings of Rāmañña seem to have been in the habit of giving a special maintenance to Singhalese envoys sent to their country.  The chief trade between the two countries was in elephants; the king of Rāmañña made a gift of an elephant to every vessel bringing gifts from foreign lands.  In the time of Parakkamabāhu I., relations were strained between the two countries as a result of insults paid by the king of Rāmañña, and Parakkamabāhu sent a punitive expedition under the Damilādhikārin, Ādicca.  This expedition started from Pallavanka, and some of the forces landed at Kusumī in Rāmañña and the others at Papphālama.  It is said that in a battle fought at Ukkama, the Singhalese forces killed the Rāmañña king.  Thereafter, through the intervention of the monks, peace was restored between the two countries, and the Ramanas, as the people of Rāmañña were called, sent a yearly tribute to the king of Ceylon.

[/p][p][/p][p]In the Ambattha Sutta (D.i.92) it is stated that Okkāka, being fond of his queen and wishing to transfer the kingdom to her son, banished from the kingdom the elder princes by another wife.  These princes were named Okkāmukha, Karakanda, Hatthinika, and Sīnipura.  [/p][p][/p][p]The Mahāvastu (which confuses Iksvāku with his ancestor Sujāta) mentions five sons of Iksvāku: Opura, Ulkāmukha, Karandaka, Hastikasīrsa and Nipura (i.348).  See also Rockhill, p.9ff.[/p][p][/p][p]They lived on the slopes of the Himalaya and, consorting with their sisters and their descendants, formed the Sākyan race.  The legend, thus briefly given, is enlarged on with great detail in the Commentaries.  According to Buddhaghosa, there are three dynasties with a king named Okkāka at the head of each, all of them lineal descendants of the primeval king, Mahāsammata, and in the line of succession of Makādeva.[/p][p][/p][p]The Okkāka of the third dynasty bad five queens - Bhattā, Cittā, Jantū, Jālinī and Visākhā - each with five hundred female attendants.  The eldest queen had four sons - mentioned above - and five daughters - Piyā, Suppiyā, Anandā, Vijitā and Vijitasenā.  (The Mtu.  calls them Suddhā, Vimalā Vijitā, Jālā and Jālī).[/p][p][/p][p]When Bhattā died, after the birth of these nine children, the king married another young and beautiful princess and made her the chief queen.  Her son was Jantu, and being pleased with him, the king promised her a boon.  She claimed the kingdom for her son, and this was the reason for the exile of the elder children (DA.i.258f; SnA.i.352f).  [/p][p][/p][p]The Mahāvamsa (Mhv.ii.12-16) mentions among Okkāka's descendants, Nipuna, Candimā, Candamukha, Sivisañjaya, Vessantara, Jāli, Sīhavāhana and Sīhassara.  The last named had eighty-four thousand descendants, the last of whom was Jayasena.  His son Sīhahanu was the grandfather of the Buddha.  The Dīpavamsa (iii.41-5) list resembles this very closely.[/p][p][/p][p]Okkāka had a slave-girl called Disā, who gave birth to a black baby named, accordingly, Kanha.  He was the ancestor of the Kanhāyanas, of which race the Ambattha-clan was an offshoot.  Later, Kanha became a mighty sage and, by his magic power, won in marriage Maddarūpī, another daughter of Okkāka (D.i.93, 96).[/p][p][/p][p]According to the Brāhmana-Dhammika Sutta (Sn.p.52ff; AA.ii.737), it was during the time of Okkāka that the brahmins started their practice of slaughtering animals for sacrifice.  Till then there had been only three diseases in the world - desire, hunger and old age; but from this time onwards the enraged devas afflicted humans with various kinds of suffering.[/p][p][/p][p]It is said (DA.i.258) that the name Okkāka was given to the king because when he spoke light issued from his mouth like a torch (kathanakāle ukkā viya mukhato pabhā niccharati).[/p][p][/p][p]Although the Sanskritised form of the Pāli name is Iksavāku, it is unlikely that Okkāka is identical with the famous Iksavāku of the Purānas, the immediate son of Manu, son of the Sun.  The Pāli is evidently more primitive, as is shown by the form Okkāmukha, and the name Iksavāku looks like a deliberate attempt at accommodation to the Purānic account.  For discussion see Thomas, op.  cit., p.6.[/p][p][/p][p]According to the Mahāvastu, Iksavāku was the king of the Kosalas and his capital was Sāketa - i.e.  Ayodhyā.  See also s.v.

[/p][p]In the time of Vipassī Buddha they were again brothers in a rich family of Bandhumatī, the elder being called Sena and the younger Aparājita.  Sena entered the Order and became an arahant.  At his suggestion, Aparāijita (According to DhA.iii.364, both uncle and nephew were called Avaroja) built for the Buddha a very costly Gandhakuti, with the seven kinds of precious things.  His nephew, also called Aparājita, built an elephant stable in front of the Gandhakuti and was reborn in this age as  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/mendaka,Mendaka')"]Mendaka[/a].  The Gandhakuti and its surroundings contained all kinds of luxuries and splendours beyond description.  (For details see DhA.iv.203f).  Within and without the chamber he caused jewels, pounded and otherwise, to be strewn knee deep.  Those who came to listen to the Buddha went away, their hands full of jewels.  One day a brahmin tried to carry away a very costly jewel, which much annoyed Aparājita.  On mentioning it to the Buddha, the Buddha taught him to make a wish that his property should not be taken away by thieves or lost by fire or water.  For nine months Aparājita held the ceremony of dedication of the Gandhakuti.[/p][p]In this age he was born as the son of a setthi in  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"]Rājagaha[/a].

The king,  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bimbisara,Bimbisāra')"]Bimbisāra[/a], gave one thousand a day for his milk-money.  When the time came for his marriage,  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka,Sakka')"]Sakka[/a] provided for him a palace, seven storeys high, made entirely of precious minerals.  Four urns of treasure stood at the four corners and four stalks of sugar-cane made of solid gold, each the size of a palmyra tree with leaves of precious stones, to remind Jotika of his good deed in the past.  Seven Yakkhas guarded the seven gates - Yamakolī, Uppala, Vajira, Vajirabāhu, Kasakanda, Katattha and Disāpāmukha - each with numerous followers.  Bimbisāra, hearing of his splendour, appointed Jotika to the rank of setthi.[/p][p]The gods brought him a wife from  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uttarakuru,Uttarakuru')"]Uttarakuru[/a] and lodged her in an apartment in Jotika's palace.  Her name was  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/satulakayi,Satulakāyī')"]Satulakāyī[/a] (DhA.iv.223).  She brought with her a pint-pot of rice and three crystal fire-stones.  Whenever they wished to eat, they would put rice over the boiler and set it over the crystals.  The stones would immediately become alight and, when the meal was cooked, would extinguish themselves.  The pot was inexhaustible.  All who came to visit Jotika were provided with food and were allowed to take anything they wished from the treasure, the treasure never growing less.  So great were the crowds which flocked to Jotika's palace that for a long time Bimbisāra had no chance of seeing it.  When Bimbisāra did in the end visit him with Ajātasattu, Jotika invited him to a meal which was the most dainty the king had ever tasted.  After the meal Jotika presented his wife to Bimbisāra; so delicately was she nurtured that the perfume with which the king was scented hurt her eyes! There were no lamps in Jotika's house; only the light of jewels was made use of, and as a memento of Bimbisāra's visit Jotika gave him a huge jewel to be used as a lamp.  (This account is taken from DhA.iv.199-213).[/p][p]Jotika was a very pious follower of the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"]Buddha[/a].

But the Yakkha Yamakolī routed the army, and Ajātasattu fled for refuge to the vihāra where Jotika was listening to the Dhamma.  On being charged by Ajātasattu with hypocrisy in that he was there listening to the Dhamma, after having charged his guards to set upon the king, Jotika's answer was that he had no need of guards since nobody could take anything of his without his sanction.  He then challenged the king to remove the rings from his (Jotika's) fingers.  Ajātasattu, trying with all his might, failed.  Jotika then held out his hands and his rings all fell off.  Agitated by the king's desire to possess his wealth, Jotika asked for permission to become a monk.  Ajātasattu agreed, hoping thus to get possession of his riches.  Jotika entered the Order and soon became an arahant, but at the moment of his attainment of arahantship all his wealth and earthly glory vanished and his wife returned to Uttarakuru (DhA.iv.221-4).[/p][p]Jotika is included among the five persons who possessed great merit and had puññiddhi.[/p][p]DhA.i.385; Vsm.383; PsA.502.

Jatila.[/b]-A class of ascetics, so called on account of their matted hair (jatilā ti tāpasā, to hi jatādhāritāya idha jatilā ti vuttā) (UdA.74; see also 330).  These ascetics are sometimes classed under isi (Culla Nid.149) and also under muni (Culla Nid.513).[/p][hr][p][b]2. Jatila.[/b]-A governor of a province (Mahāratthiya) in the time of Padumuttara Buddha.  He was the Bodhisatta.  v.l.  Jatika.  J.i.37; Bu.xi.11.[/p][hr][p][b]3. Jatila (v.l.  Jatilaka).[/b]-A setthi of Magadha, one of the five setthis of Bimbisāra (DhA.i.385).  His mother was a setthi's daughter in Benares, who had illicit relations with a Vijjādhara, and when the child was born she placed it in a vessel which she handed to her slave, to be floated down the Ganges.  Two women, while bathing, saw the vessel, discovered what it contained and each claimed the child.  The dispute was settled by the king and the child was given to the woman who happened to be a disciple of Mahā Kaccāna.  The child was called Jatila because the first time he was bathed after birth his hair became matted.  When able to walk, he was given to Mahā Kaccāna to be ordained, but the thera took him to Takkasilā and handed him over to one of his supporters, a merchant, who adopted him as his son.  Years passed, and one day the merchant, having to go on a journey, made a list of the goods which he had accumulated in his house during twelve years and asked Jatila to sell them if he could find buyers.  Such was the lad's fortune that in one day they were all disposed of.  The merchant, realising the young man's destiny, gave him his daughter in marriage and provided him with a house.  As Jatila stepped into the house, the earth behind it was rent asunder and a mountain of gold, eighty cubits in height, appeared for his use.  Thereupon the king made him a Treasurer.  Later, wishing to retire from the world, Jatila sent out messengers to discover if there were others as rich as he, in case the king should raise objections to his going away.  When news was brought back of Mendaka and Jotika, he knew there would be no opposition and obtained the king's permission.  He had three sons, but, having tested them, came to know that only the youngest had the necessary good fortune to enjoy his vast wealth.  Jatila thereupon handed over to him his wealth and entered the Order, becoming an arahant within a few days.  Some time afterwards the Buddha, with Jatila and other monks, was entertained for a fortnight by Jatila's sons, and in answer to the monks' questions Jatila declared that he felt no desire to re-enter household life.  The monks found this hard to believe till assured by the Buddha that it was so.[/p][p][/p][p]In the time of Kassapa Buddha, Jatila was a goldsmith.  One day, an arahant, seeking for gold wherewith to complete the shrine erected over the Buddha's remains, came to the goldsmith's house; the latter, having just quarrelled with his wife, was in a surly mood and said to the arahant, "Throw your teacher into the water and get away." His wife told him how wicked were his words, and he, realising his fault, asked pardon of the arahant and made valuable offerings at the Buddha's shrine, by way of amends.  Of his three sons whom he asked, in turn, to help him with the preparations, only the youngest consented to go with him.  Therefore it was that in seven successive states Jatila was thrown into the water on the day of his birth and only his youngest son could enjoy his wealth (DhA.iv.214ff; PsA.502f).[/p][p][/p][p]Jatila's possession of a golden mountain is given as an example of puññiddhi, he being one of the five persons of great merit.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Jānussonī[/div][p]A mahāsāla brahmin, ranking with eminent brahmins such as Cankī, Tārukkha, Pokkharasāti and Todeyya (SN.  p.115).  He is mentioned as staying in Icchānangala (M.ii.196), where he evidently took part in the periodical gatherings of brahmin leaders - and also at Manasākata (D.i.235).  He was a follower of the Buddha, of whom he was a great admirer.  He appears to have been in the habit of talking to well known teachers of other schools and hearing their opinion of the Buddha, either for the purpose of comparing his own faith in him or of discovering their views.  Two such conversations are recorded - one with Subha Todeyyaputta (M.ii.209), the other with Pilotika (M.i.175ff).  His discussion with Pilotika he reported to the Buddha, who expanded it to form the Culahatthipadopama Sutta.  The Buddha also preached to Jānussoni the Bhayabherava Sutta (M.i.16ff).  Jānussoni's permanent residence was Sāvatthi (DA.ii.399), and he often visited the Buddha at Jetavana, consulting him on many topics, such as: results of actions (A.i.56), sanditthaka-nibbāna (A.i.157), tevijja-brahmins (A.i.166), fearlessness of death (A.ii.173), the ideals of various classes of persons (A.iii.362), true celibacy (A.iv.54), the Paccārohani ceremony (A.v.233ff., 249ff.), the efficacy of gifts (A.v.269ff.), and eternalism and annihilation (S.ii.76).  He had a white chariot with silver fittings and white trappings drawn by four pure white mares.  He would drive about in this, wearing white garments, turban-cloths and sandals and fanned by a white fan.  The reins, the goads and the canopy were also of white.  His chariot was considered the finest in all Sāvatthi (S.v.4f; cp.  M.i.175 and ii.208).  Buddhaghosa says that Jānussoni was not his personal name but the name of the rank he held as chaplain to the Kosala king.  MA.i.90; according to AA.  (i.308) it was the name of any noble family, members of which held this rank.  Cp.  Govindiye abhisiñci (at D.ii.231).[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Javanahamsa Jātaka (No.476)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta was once king of ninety thousand geese in Cittakūta.  The king of Benares, seeing him, took a great fancy to him and did him honour, desiring his friendship.  When the king went to Anotatta, the Bodhisatta did him similar honour and friendship was established between them.  One day, two of the young geese, in spite of the advice of the Bodhisatta, wished to try their speed against the sun.  Their king, wishing to save them from death, went with them, rescuing them when tired.  Then he himself raced the sun and was victorious, arriving at the king's palace.  The king, hearing of this, wished to see an exhibition of the Bodhisatta's powers of speed, and his desire was granted.  When asked whether anything was fleeter than himself, the king of the geese replied that the decay of the elements of life was a thousand-fold speedier.

The Buddha, reading his thoughts, preached a sermon, intended for him, on the evils of pride, and Jenta became a Sotāpanna.  Later he entered the Order and became an arahant (Thag.vs.423-8; ThagA.i.455f).  Perhaps he is to be identified with Manātthaddha of the Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.177; KS.i.224, n.1).[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Jetavana[/div][hr][p][b]1. Jetavana.[/b]-A park in Sāvatthi, in which was built the Anāthapindikārāma.  When the Buddha accepted Anāthapindika's invitation to visit Sāvatthi the latter, seeking a suitable place for the Buddha's residence, discovered this park belonging to Jetakumāra (MA.i.471 says it was in the south of Sāvatthi).  When he asked to be allowed to buy it, Jeta's reply was: "Not even if you could cover the whole place with money." Anāthapindika said that he would buy it at that price, and when Jeta answered that he had had no intention of making a bargain, the matter was taken before the Lords of Justice, who decided that if the price mentioned were paid, Anāthapindika had the right of purchase.  Anāthapindika had gold brought down in carts and covered Jetavana with pieces laid side by side.  (This incident is illustrated in a bas-relief at the Bharhut Tope; see Cunningham - the Stūpa of Bharhut, Pl.lvii., pp.84-6).  The money brought in the first journey was found insufficient to cover one small spot near the gateway.  So Anāthapindika sent his servants back for more, but Jeta, inspired by Anāthapindika's earnestness, asked to be allowed to give this spot.  Anāthapindika agreed and Jeta erected there a gateway, with a room over it.  Anāthapindika built in the grounds dwelling rooms, retiring rooms, store rooms and service halls, halls with fireplaces, closets, cloisters, halls for exercise, wells, bathrooms, ponds, open and roofed sheds, etc.  (Vin.ii.158f).[/p][p]It is said (MA.i.50; UdA.56f) that Anāthapindika paid eighteen crores for the purchase of the site, all of which Jeta spent in the construction of the gateway gifted by him.  (The gateway was evidently an imposing structure; see J.ii.216).[/p][p]Jeta gave, besides, many valuable trees for timber.  Anāthapindika himself spent fifty-four crores in connection with the purchase of the park and the buildings erected in it.[/p][p]The ceremony of dedication was one of great splendour.  Not only Anāthapindika himself, but his whole family took part: his son with five hundred other youths, his wife with five hundred other noble women, and his daughters Mahā Subhaddā and Cūla Subhaddā with five hundred other maidens.  Anāthapindika was attended by five hundred bankers.  The festivities in connection with the dedication lasted for nine months (J.i.92ff).[/p][p]Some of the chief buildings attached to the Jetavana are mentioned in the books by special names, viz., Mahāgandhakuti, Kaverimandalamāla, Kosambakuti and Candanamāla.  SNA.ii.403. Other buildings are also mentioned - e.g., the Ambalakotthaka-āsanasālā (J.ii.246).  According to Tibetan sources the vihāra was built according to a plan sent by the devas of Tusita and contained sixty large halls and sixty small.  The Dulva also gives details of the decorative scheme of the vihāra (Rockhill: op.  cit.48 and n.2).[/p][p]All these were built by Anāthapindika; there was another large building erected by Pasenadi and called the Salalaghara (DA.ii.407).  Over the gateway lived a guardian deity to prevent all evildoers from entering (SA.i.239).  Just outside the monastery was a rājayatana-tree, the residence of the god Samiddhisumana (Mhv.i.52f; MT 105; but see DhA.i.41, where the guardian of the gateway is called Sumana).[/p][p]In the grounds there seems to have been a large pond which came to be called the Jetavanapokkharanī.  (AA.i.264; here the Buddha often bathed (J.i.329ff.).  Is this the Pubbakotthaka referred to at A.iii.345? But see S.v.220; it was near this pond that Devadatta was swallowed up in Avīci (J.iv.158)).  [/p][p]The grounds themselves were thickly covered with trees, giving the appearance of a wooded grove (arañña) (Sp.iii.532).  On the outskirts of the monastery was a mango-grove (J.iii.137).  In front of the gateway was the Bodhi-tree planted by Anāthapindika, which came later to be called the Anandabodhi (q.v.) (J.iv.228f).  Not far from the gateway was a cave which became famous as the Kapallapūvapabbhāra on account of an incident connected with Macchariya-Kosiya (J.i.348).[/p][p]Near Jetavana was evidently a monastery of the heretics where Ciñcāmānavikā spent her nights while hatching her conspiracy against the Buddha.  (DhA.iii.179; behind Jetavana was a spot where the Ajivakas practised their austerities (J.i.493).  Once the heretics bribed Pasenadi to let them make a rival settlement behind Jetavana, but the Buddha frustrated their plans (J.ii.170)).  [/p][p]There seems to have been a playground just outside Jetavana used by the children of the neighbourhood, who, when thirsty, would go into Jetavana to drink (DhA.iii.492).  The high road to Sāvatthi passed by the edge of Jetavana, and travellers would enter the park to rest and refresh themselves (J.ii.203, 341; see also vi.70, where two roads are mentioned).  [/p][p]According to the Divyāvadāna (Dvy.395f), the thūpas of Sāriputta and Moggallāna were in the grounds of Jetavana and existed until the time of Asoka.  Both Fa Hien (Giles: p.33ff) and Houien Thsang (Beal.ii.7ff) give descriptions of other incidents connected with the Buddha, which took place in the neighbourhood of Jetavana - e.g., the murder of Sundarikā, the calumny of Ciñcā, Devadatta's attempt to poison the Buddha, etc.[/p][p]The space covered by the four bedposts of the Buddha's Gandhakuti in Jetavana is one of the four avijahitatthānāni; all Buddhas possess the same, though the size of the actual vihāra differs in the case of the various Buddhas.  For Vipassī Buddha, the setthi Punabbasumitta built a monastery extending for a whole league, while for Sikhī, the setthi Sirivaddha made one covering three gavutas.  The Sanghārāma built by Sotthiya for Vessabhū was half a league in extent, while that erected by Accuta for Kakusandha covered only one gāvuta.  Konagamana's monastery, built by the setthi Ugga, extended for half a gāvuta, while Kassapa's built by Sumangala covered sixteen karīsas.  Anāthapindika's monastery covered a space of eighteen karīsas (BuA.2, 47; J.i.94; DA.ii.424).[/p][p]The Buddha spent nineteen rainy seasons in Jetavana (DhA.i.3; BuA.3; AA.i.314).  It is said that after the Migāramātupāsāda came into being, the Buddha would dwell alternately in Jetavana and Migāramātupāsāda, often spending the day in one and the night in the other (SNA.i.336).[/p][p]According to a description given by Fa Hien (Giles, pp.31, 33), the vihāra was originally in seven sections (storeys?) and was filled with all kinds of offerings, embroidered banners, canopies, etc., and the lamps burnt from dusk to dawn.[/p][p]One day a rat, holding in its mouth a lamp wick, set fire to the banners and canopies, and all the seven sections were entirely destroyed.  The vihāra was later rebuilt in two sections.  There were two main entrances, one on the east, one on the west, and Fa Hsien found thūpas erected at all the places connected with the Buddha, each with its name inscribed.[/p][p]The vihāra is almost always referred to as Jetavane Anāthapindikassa Ārāma.  The Commentaries (MA.ii.50; UdA.56f, etc.) say that this was deliberate (at the Buddha's own suggestion pp.81-131; Beal: op.  cit., ii.5 and Rockhill: p.49), in order that the names of both earlier and later owners might be recorded and that people might be reminded of two men, both very generous in the cause of the Religion, so that others might follow their example.  The vihāra is sometimes referred to as Jetārāma (E.g., Ap.i.400).[/p][p]In the district of Saheth-Mabeth, with which the region of Sāvatthi is identified, Saheth is considered to be Jetavana (Arch.  Survey of India, 1907-8, pp.81-131).[/p][hr][p][b]2. Jetavana.[/b]-A monastery in Anurādhapura, situated in the Jotivana (q.v.) and founded by Mahāsena at the instigation of a monk named Tissa of the Dakkhinārāma.  The monks of the Mahāvihāra protested against this and Jetavana was later given to them (Mhv.xxxvii.32ff).  Attached to the vihāra is a large thūpa.  The work was completed by Sirimeghavanna (Cv.xxxvii.65).  Dāthāpabhuti held in the vihāra the ceremony in honour of the Dhammadhātu (Cv.xli.40; also Cv.Trs.i.55, n.2), while Mahānāga gave to it the village of Vasabha in Uddhagāma and three hundred fields, to ensure a permanent supply of rice gruel to the monks (Cv.xli.97f).  Aggabodhi II.  crowned the thūpa with a lightning conductor (cumbata) (Cv.xlii.66), Jetthatissa I.  gave for its maintenance the village of Gondigāma (Cv.xliv.97), and Aggabodhi III.  bestowed on it the Mahāmanikagāma (Cv.xliv.121).  Potthasāta, senāpati of Aggabodhi IV., built in the vihāra the Aggabodhi-parivena (Cv.xlvi.22), and Aggabodhi IX.  made a golden image to be placed in the shrine-room (Cv.xlix.77).[/p][p]Sena I.  erected in the monastery grounds a mansion of several storeys (Cv., l.65).

(AA.  (i.216) says that  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/abhaya,Abhayarājakumāra')"]Abhayarājakumāra[/a] was his father).  Directly after birth the child was placed in a basket and thrown on a dust-heap, from where he was rescued by Abhayarājakumāra.  When questioned by Abhaya, people said "he was alive" (jīvati), and therefore the child was called Jīvaka; because he was brought up by the prince (kumārena posāpito), he was called Komārabhacca.  It has been suggested, however, that Komārabhacca meant master of the Kaumārabhrtya science (the treatment of infants); VT.ii.174; in Dvy.  (506-18) he is called Kumārabhūta.[/p][p]When grown up, he learnt of his antecedents, and going to  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/takkasilaa,Takkasilā')"]Takkasilā[/a] without Abhaya's knowledge, studied medicine for seven years.  His teacher then gave him a little money and sent him away as being fit to practise medicine.  His first patient was the setthi's wife at Sāketa, and for curing her he received sixteen thousand kahāpanas, a manservant, a maid-servant and a coach with horses.  When he returned to Rājagaha, Abhaya established him in his own residence.  There he cured  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bimbisara,Bimbisāra')"]Bimbisāra[/a] of a troublesome fistula and received as reward all the ornaments of Bimbisāra's five hundred wives.  He was appointed physician to the king and the king's women and also to the fraternity of monks with the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"]Buddha[/a] at its head.  Other cures of Jīvaka's included that of the setthi of Rājagaha on whom he performed the operation of trepanning, and of the son of the setthi of Benares who had suffered from chronic intestinal trouble due to misplacement, and for this case Jīvaka received sixteen thousand kahāpanas.[/p][p]When  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cannda_ppajjota,Candappajjota')"]Candappajjota[/a], king of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ujjenii,Ujjeni')"]Ujjeni[/a], was ill, Bimbisāra lent Jīvaka to him.  Candappajjota hated ghee, which was, however, the only remedy.  Jīvaka prepared the medicine, prescribed it for the king, then rode away on the king's elephant Bhaddavatikā before the king discovered the nature of the medicine.  Pajjota, in a rage, ordered his capture and sent his slave Kāka after him.  Kāka discovered Jīvaka breakfasting at Kosambī and allowed himself to be persuaded to eat half a myrobalan, which purged him violently.  Jīvaka explained to Kāka that he wished to delay his return; he told him why he had fled from the court and, having returned the elephant, proceeded to Rājagaha.  Pajjota was cured and, as a token of his favour, sent Jīvaka a suit of Sīveyyaka cloth, which Jīvaka presented to the Buddha (Vin.i.268-81; AA.i.216).  Jīvaka was greatly attracted by the Buddha.  Once when the Buddha was ill, Jīvaka found it necessary to administer a purge, and he had fat rubbed into the Buddha's body and gave him a handful of lotuses to smell.  Jīvaka was away when the purgative acted, and suddenly remembered that he had omitted to ask the Buddha to bathe in warm water to complete the cure.  The Buddha read his thoughts and bathed as required.  Vin.i.279f; DhA.  (ii.164f), relates a like occurrence in another connection.  When the Buddha's foot was injured by the splinter from the rock hurled by  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta,Devadatta')"]Devadatta[/a], he had to be carried from [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maddakucci,Maddakucchi')"]Maddakucchi[/a] to Jīvaka's Ambavana.  There Jīvaka applied an astringent, and having bandaged the wound, left the city expecting to return in time to remove it.  But by the time he did return, the city gates were closed and he could not enter.  He was greatly worried because he knew that if the bandage remained on all night the Buddha would suffer intense pain.  But the Buddha read his thoughts and removed the bandage.  See also J.v.333.[/p][p]After Jīvaka became a Sotāpanna, he was anxious to visit the Buddha twice a day, and finding  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/veluvana,Veluvana')"]Veluvana[/a] too far away, he built a monastery with all its adjuncts in his own Ambavana in Rājagaha, which he gave to the Buddha and his monks (DA.i.133; MA.ii.590).  When Bimbisāra died, Jīvaka continued to serve Ajātasattu, and was responsible for bringing him to the Buddha after his crime of parricide.  (For details see the Sāmaññaphala Sutta; also J.i.508f; v.262, etc.).[/p][p]Jīvaka's fame as a physician brought him more work than he could cope with, but he never neglected his duties to the Sangha.  Many people, afflicted with disease and unable to pay for treatment by him, joined the Order in order that they might receive that treatment.  On discovering that the Order was thus being made a convenience of, he asked the Buddha to lay down a rule that men afflicted with certain diseases should be refused entry into the Order (Vin.i.71ff).  Jīvaka was declared by the Buddha chief among his lay followers loved by the people (aggam puggalappasannānam) (A.i.26).  He is included in a list of good men who have been assured of the realisation of deathlessness (A.iii.451; DhA.i.244, 247; J.i.116f).[/p][p]At a meal once given by Jīvaka, the Buddha refused to be served until Cūlapanthaka, who had been left out of the invitation, had been sent for.  (For details see  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cuula_panthaka_th,Cūlapanthaka')"]Cūlapanthaka[/a]).

[/p][p]Janapadakalyānī was engaged to be married to  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nanda,Nanda')"]Nanda[/a], but on the day fixed for the marriage the Buddha induced Nanda to join the Order, in spite of Nanda's wishes, and in due course he became an arahant.  Later, when women were admitted to the Order, Janapadakalyānī, feeling she had nothing to look forward to, became a Bhikkhunī under  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapajapati_gotami,Pajāpatī')"]Pajāpatī[/a].  For a long time she would not visit the Buddha, having heard that he spoke disparagingly of physical beauty, but one day, inspired by curiosity, she accompanied her colleagues to hear the Buddha preach.  He, being aware of her thoughts, created the form of a most beautiful maiden who stood fanning him.  As Janapadakalyānī sat gazing at her, enraptured by her beauty, she saw her gradually reach extreme old age, passing through all the stages, until at last she saw her die, leaving her body to decompose and become a mass of filth.  At the critical moment, the Buddha uttered the appropriate words and Janapadakalyānī became a Sotāpanna.

Being asked the reason for this method of life, Kassapa answers that it is for his own happiness and out of compassion for those that come after (S.ii.202).

When he grew older he was ordained with the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aajiivakaa,Ājīvakas')"]Ājīvakas[/a], who pulled out his hair with a palmyra comb.  When the Ajivakas discovered that he ate filth, they expelled him and he lived as a naked ascetic, practising all kinds of austerities and accepting no offerings save butter and honey placed on the tip of his tongue with the point of a blade of grass.  His fame spread far.  When he was fifty-five years old, the Buddha visited him and spent the night in a cave near his abode.  During the night, Jambuka saw mighty gods come to pay homage to the Buddha and was so impressed that the next day he sought the Buddha's counsel.  The Buddha told him of his past evil deeds which had condemned him to practise austerities for so long and counselled him to give up his evil ways.  In the course of the sermon, Jambuka grew ashamed of his nakedness and the Buddha gave him a bath-robe.  At the end of the discourse Jambuka became an arahant, and when the inhabitants of Anga and Magadha came to him with their offerings, he performed a miracle before them and paid homage to the Buddha, acknowledging him as his teacher.[/p][p]In the time of Kassapa Buddha, Jambuka was a monk and had a lay patron who looked after him.  One day a pious monk came to his vihāra, and the layman, being pleased with him, showed him much attention.  The resident monk, very jealous, reviled the visitor, saying, "It would be better for you to eat filth than food in this layman's house, to tear your hair with a palmyra comb than let his barber cut it for you, to go naked than wear robes given by him, to lie on the ground than on a bed provided by him." The Elder, not wishing to be the cause of his sinning, left the monastery the next day.  Because of this act, the meditations practised by Jambuka for twenty thousand years were of no avail, and he was born in Avīci, where he suffered torments during an interval between two Buddhas.  In this last life, too, he was condemned to suffer in many ways, as related above (DhA.ii.52-63; Thag.283-6; ThagA.i.386f).[/p][p]In the time of Tissa Buddha he was a householder and made offerings at the Buddha's Bodhi-tree, fanning the Buddha's seat with a fan.  He is probably identical with Sīhāsanavījanīya of the Apadāna (Ap.ii.403).[/p][p]It is said (Mil.350; AA.i.57) that when the Buddha preached to Jambuka, eighty-four thousand others realised the Truth.[/p][hr][p][b]2.

Junha took no notice, so the brahmin uttered a stanza to the effect that a king should not neglect a brahmin's request.

They had eminent followers such as high court officials (Vin.ii.166; iv.71) and that, for centuries at least, they retained an important position, is shown by their being thrice mentioned in the Asoka Edicts as receiving royal gifts (Hultsch: Asoka Inscriptions, see Index).[/p][p]The doctrines held by the Ājīvaka are mentioned in several places, but the best known account is in the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/samannaphala_s,Sāmaññaphala Sutta')"]Sāmaññaphala Sutta[/a] where they are attributed to Makkhali Gosāla by name (D.i.53-4. See also M.i.516f).  He maintained that there is no cause or reason for either depravity or purity among beings.  There is no such thing as intrinsic strength, or energy or human might or endeavour.  All creatures, all beings, everything that has life, all are devoid of power, strength and energy; all are under the compulsion of the individual nature to which they are linked by destiny; it is solely by virtue of their birth in the six environments (chalabhijātiyo) that they experience their pleasure or pain.  The universe is divided into various classes of beings, of occupations and methods of production.  There are eighty-four hundred thousand periods during which both fools and wise alike, wandering in transmigration, shall at last make an end of pain.  The pleasures and pain, measured out as it were with a measure, cannot be altered in the course of transmigration; there can be neither increase nor decrease thereof, neither excess nor deficiency.[/p][p]The fundamental point in their teaching seems, therefore, to have been "samsāra-suddhi," purification through transmigration, which probably meant that all beings, all lives, all existent things, all living substances attain and must attain, perfection in course of time.[/p][p]According to  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa,Buddhaghosa')"]Buddhaghosa[/a] (DA.i.161), in the classification of the Ājīvaka:[/p][ul][li][p]"all beings" (sattā) meant all kinds of animals, camels, cows, asses, etc.; [/p][/li][li][p]"all lives" (pānā) comprised all sensitive things and sentient creatures divided into those with one sense (ekendriya), those with two senses and so forth; [/p][/li][li][p]"all existent things" (bhūtā) denoted all living beings divided into generic types - viz., those produced from an egg, or born from the womb, or sprung from moisture, or propagated from seed;[/p][/li][li][p]"all living substances" (jivā) denoted rice, barley, wheat, etc.[/p][/li][/ul][p]The division of men into six classes (chalabhijātiyo) is noteworthy.  Buddhaghosa describes these as being kanha, nīla, lohita, halidda, sukka and paramasukka.  This closely resembles the curious Jaina doctrine of the six Lesyas.  Given, e.g., in the Uttarādhyāyana Sutra (Jacobi's Jaina Sūtras ii.213).  This seems to involve a conception of mind which is originally colourless by nature.  The different colours (nīla, etc.) are due to different habits or actions.  The supreme spiritual effort consists in restoring mind to its original purity.  Cp.  with this the Buddha's teaching in A.iii.384ff.  and M.i.36. [/p][p]In the Anguttara Nikāya (iii.383-4) a similar doctrine is attributed to  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/purana_kassapa,Pūrana Kassapa')"]Pūrana Kassapa[/a].[/p][p]Gosāla's theory (D.i.54; see also S.iii.211) of the divisions of the universe into fourteen hundred thousand principle states of birth - (pamukhayoniyo) and into various methods of regeneration - viz., [/p][ul][li][p]seven kinds of animate (saññigabbhā) production, i.e.  by means of separate sexes; [/p][/li][li][p]seven of inanimate (asaññigabbhā), such as rice, barley, etc.; [/p][/li][li][p]seven of production by grafting (niganthigabbhā), propagating by joints, such as sugar cane, etc.  - [/p][/li][/ul][p]seems to show that the Ājīvaka believed in infinite gradations of existence, in the infinity of time, and also in the recurrent cycles of existence.  Each individual has external existence, if not individually, at least in type.  In the world as a whole everything comes about by necessity.  Fate (nigati) regulates everything, all things being unalterably fixed.  Just as a ball of string when cast forth spreads out just as far as, and no farther than it can unwind, so every being lives, acts, enjoys and ultimately ends, in the manner in which it is destined (sandhavitvā, samsaritvā dukkhassantam karissanti).  The peculiar nature (bhāva) (DA.i.161) of each being depends on the class or species or type to which it belongs.[/p][p]Among the views of the Puthusamanas (other teachers), the Buddha regarded the doctrine of the Ājīvaka as the least desirable.  It denied [/p][ul][li][p]action (kiriya), [/p][/li][li][p]endeavour (viriya), [/p][/li][li][p]result of action (kamma), [/p][/li][/ul][p]and was therefore despicable (patikhitto) (A.i.286).  [/p][p]The Buddha knew of no other single person fraught with such danger and sorrow to all devas and men as was Makkhali; like a fish-trap set at a river mouth, Makkhali was born into the world to be a man-trap for the distress and destruction of men (A.i.33).[/p][p]According to Buddhaghosa (DA.i.166), [/p][ul][li][p] [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/purana_kassapa,Pūrana Kassapa')"]Pūrana Kassapa[/a], by propounding a theory of the passivity of soul, denied action; [/p][/li][li][p] [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajitakesakambala,Ajita Kesakambala')"]Ajita Kesakambala[/a], by his theory of annihilation, denied retribution, [/p][/li][li][p] [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/makkhali_gosala,Makkhali Gosāla')"]Makkhali Gosāla[/a], by his doctrine of fate, denied both action and its result.[/p][/li][/ul][p]It has been suggested (E.g.  Barua: Pre-Buddhistic Indian Philosophy, p.314) that Makkhali Gosāla's doctrine of the eight developmental stages of man (attha purisabhūmi) was a physical antecedent of the Buddha's doctrine of the eight higher spiritual ranks (attha purisapuggalā).  [/p][p]Buddhaghosa gives the eight stages as follows: manda, khiddā, vīmamsana, ujugata, sekha, samana, jina and panna.  DA.i.162 ; see also Hoernle's Uvāsaga-Dasāo, ii.  p.24, where pannaka is given for panna.  op.  J.iv.496-7, mandadasaka,khiddā-dasaka,anna-dasaka,etc.[/p][p][/p][ul][li][p]The first stage extends from the first day of birth to the seventh.  [/p][/li][li][p]In the second stage those who have come from evil states cry constantly, those from happy conditions smile, remembering their past lives.  [/p][/li][li][p]The third stage is marked by the infant beginning to walk with the help of others.  The time of his being able to walk alone is the ujugata-bhūmi.  [/p][/li][li][p]The period of study is sekha-bhūmi, [/p][/li][li][p]of leaving household life, samana-bhūmi; [/p][/li][li][p]the period of knowledge (vijānana), [/p][/li][li][p]of constant association with teachers, is the jina-bhūmi and [/p][/li][li][p]the last stage when the jina remains silent (pannaka), is called the pannaka-bhūmi.  [/p][/li][/ul][p]This seems to indicate a development of the mental and spiritual faculties, side by side with physical growth, an interaction of body and mind.[/p][p][/p][p]There seems to have been a great deal of confusion, even at the time of the compilation of the Nikāyas, as to what were the specific beliefs of the Ājīvakas.  [/p][ul][li][p]Thus in the Mahāli Sutta of the Samyutta Nikāya (iii.69) some of Gosāla's views (natthi hetu, natthi paccayo sattānam sankilesāya) are attributed to Pūrana Kassapa.  [/p][/li][li][p]The Anguttara Nikāya in one place (i.286) apparently confounds Makkhali Gosāla with Ajita Kesakambala, [/p][/li][li][p]while elsewhere (iii.383-4) Pūrana Kassapa's views regarding the chalabhijāti are represented as being those of Makkhali.[/p][/li][/ul][p]There was a group of Ājīvakas behind Jetavana.  The monks saw the Ājīvakas perform various austerities, such as squatting on their heels, swinging in the air like bats, scorching themselves with five fires, and they asked the Buddha whether these austerities were of any use.  "None whatever," answered the Buddha, and then proceeded to relate the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nanguttha_jat_144,Nanguttha Jātaka')"]Nanguttha Jātaka[/a] (J.i.493f).[/p][p]The Ājīvakas used to be consulted regarding auspicious days, dreams, omens, etc.  (See, e.g., J.i.287 and MT.190).[/p][p]There was a settlement of Ājīvakas in  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anuraadhapura,Anurādhapura')"]Anurādhapura[/a], and Pandukābhaya built a residence for them.  Mhv.x.102.[/p][p]Thomas, following Hoernle, thinks that the term (Ājīvaka) was probably a name given by opponents, meaning one who followed the ascetic life for the sake of a livelihood.  Op.  cit., p.130. But see DhA.i.309, where the different kinds of religieux are distinguished as acelaka, ājīvaka, nigantha and tāpasa.  [/p][p]For a detailed account of the Ājīvakas see Hoernle's Article in ERA.  and Barua's paper in the Calcutta University Journal of the Dept.  of Letters, vol.ii.  Hence we cannot infer that the name which was found as late as the thirteenth century always refers to the followers of Makkhali Gosāla.  This point is certainly worth investigating.[/p]</e>

One day when he was hunting, the quarry escaped from where the king lay in wait and, according to custom, it became the king's duty to capture it.  He, therefore, followed the animal for three leagues, killed it and, having cut it in half, carried it in a pingo.  On his way back he happened to pass under the banyan tree which was the abode of the Yakkha Ālavaka.  The Yakkha had been granted a boon by the Yakkha-king, which allowed him to eat anybody who came within the shadow of the tree.  Accordingly, he seized the king, but later released him on obtaining his promise that he would provide him at regular intervals with a human being and a bowl of food (SnA.i.217ff).  [/p][p]For the rest of the story see Ālavaka Yakkha.[/p][hr][p][b]2. Ālavaka.[/b]-The [b]Yakkha[/b] referred to above.  [/p][p]King Ālavaka, with the help of the Mayor of the town (Nagaraguttika) and his ministers, was able to keep his promise for some time, by sending criminals to the Yakkha.  The Yakkha's power was such that at the sight of him men's bodies became as soft as butter.  Soon there were no criminals left, and each household was forced to contribute one child for sacrifice to the Yakkha.  [/p][p]Then women, about to bring forth children, began to leave the king's capital.  Twelve years passed in this manner and the only child left was the king's own son, Ālavaka Kumāra.  When the king learnt this, he ordered the child to be dressed in all splendour and taken to the Yakkha.  The Buddha, with his Eye of Compassion, saw what was going to happen and went to the Yakkha's abode.[/p][p]Ālavaka was away at a meeting of the Yakkhas in Himavā.  His doorkeeper Gadrabha admitted the Buddha, after warning him of the Yakkha's unmannerly nature.  The Buddha went in and sat down on Ālavaka's throne while Gadrabha went to Himavā to announce to his master the Buddha's arrival.  While the Buddha was there, preaching to Ālavaka's women-folk, the Yakkhas  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/satagira,Sātāgira')"]Sātāgira[/a] and  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hemavata,Hemavata')"]Hemavata[/a], passing through the air on their way to the assembly in Himavā, being made aware of the Buddha's presence by their inability to fly over him, descended to Ālavaka's palace and made obeisance to the Buddha before resuming their journey.[/p][p]When Ālavaka heard from Gadrabha and from Sātāgira and Hemavata of the Buddha's visit, he was greatly incensed and uttering aloud his name, he hurried to his abode.  There with all the various supernatural powers he could command he tried to dislodge the Buddha from his seat, but without success even his special weapon, the Dussāvudha being of no avail against the Buddha.  Then, approaching the Buddha, Ālavaka asked him to leave his house, which the Buddha did.  He then summoned the Buddha back and he came.  Three times this happened and three times the Buddha obeyed, judging compliance to be the best way of softening his wrath, but the fourth time the Buddha refused to return.  Thereupon Ālavaka expressed his desire to ask questions of the Buddha, hoping thereby to fatigue him.  The Buddha agreed, and when he had answered all the questions to Ālavaka's satisfaction, the latter became a  [a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/s_t/sotaapanna,Sotāpanna')"]Sotāpanna[/a] (SnA.i.239).[/p][p]At dawn of day, King Ālavaka's men brought the young prince, Ālavaka-Kumara to the Yakkha, as sacrifice.  Hearing the Yakkha's shouts of joy at the close of the Buddha's sermon, they greatly marvelled.  When they announced to Ālavaka that they had brought their offering, and handed him the child, he was much ashamed because of the Buddha's presence.  Ālavaka gave the child to the Buddha, who blessed him and gave him back to the king's messengers.  The boy, having passed from the Yakkha's hands to those of the Buddha, and from there to the king's men, thereafter became known as Hatthaka Ālavaka (SnA.i.239-40).[/p][p]When the king and the citizens heard that the Yakkha had become a follower of the Buddha, they built for him a special abode near that of Vessavana and provided him with endless gifts of flowers, perfumes, etc., for his use.  The story of Ālavaka, of which the above is a summary, is given in full in SnA.i.217-40 and in SA.i.244-59. It is also given in brief in AA.i.211-12 and with some difference in detail.  [/p][p]Ālavaka's abode was thirty leagues from Sāvatthi, and the Buddha covered the whole journey in one day (SnA.i.220).  The abode was near a banyan tree and on the ground (bhummattham,) well protected with walls, etc., and covered on the top by a metal net, it was like a cart enclosed on all sides.  It was three leagues in extent, and over it lay the road to Himavā by air (SnA.i.222).  Ascetics, having seen the glittering palace, often called to find out what it was.  Ālavaka would ask them questions regarding their faith, and when they could not answer he would assume a subtle form and, entering their hearts, would drive them mad (SnA.i.228).[/p][p]Ālavaka shouted his name before starting from Himavā to vanquish the Buddha.  He stood with his left foot on Manosilātala and his right on Kelāsakūta.  His shout was heard throughout  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jambudiipa,Jambudīpa')"]Jambudīpa[/a] and was one of the four shouts, mentioned in tradition, as having travelled so far (SnA.i.223; for the others see  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/punnaka,Punnaka')"]Punnaka[/a],  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vissakamma,Vissakamma')"]Vissakamma[/a] and  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kusa,Kusā')"]Kusā[/a]).  Ālavaka had a special weapon, the Dussāvudha, comparable to Sakka's Vajirāvudha, Vessavana's Gadāvudha and Yama's Nayanāvudha.  It had the power, if it were thrown into the sky, of stopping rain for twelve years and if cast on the earth of destroying all trees and crops for a like period.  If hurled into the sea it would dry up all the water, and it could shatter Sineru into pieces.  It was made of cloth and is described as a vatthāvudha, and it was worn as a part of the Yakkha's upper garment (uttariya).[/p][p]There are three salient features in the story of Ālavaka which link it closely to the large circle of stories grouped by Professor Watanabe (J.P.T.S.1909-10, pp.240ff) under the title of Kalmāsapāda stories: [/p][ul][li][p](1) The man-eating Yakkha; [/p][/li][li][p](2) the captured king saving himself by a promise to provide the Yakkha with offerings, and the sanctity of that promise; and [/p][/li][li][p](3) the conversion of the Yakkha.[/p][/li][/ul][p]The conversion of Ālavaka is considered one of the chief incidents of the Buddha's life (E.g., J.iv.180; vi.329; Mhv.xxx.84).[/p][p]Ālavaka's name appears in the Atānātiya Sutta, among the Yakkhas to whom followers of the Buddha should appeal for protection in time of need (D.iii.205).  (See also Ālavaka Sutta.)[/p][hr][p][b]1. Ālavaka Sutta.[/b]-Records the eight questions asked of the Buddha by Ālavaka Yakkha and the answers given by the Buddha.  It is said (SnA.i.228) that Ālavaka's parents had learnt the questions and their answers from Kassapa Buddha and had taught them to Ālavaka in his youth; but he could not remember them and, in order that they might be preserved, he had them written on a gold leaf with red paint, and this he stored away in his palace.  When the Buddha answered the questions he found that the answers were exactly the same as those given by Kassapa (SnA.i.231).  [/p][p]The sutta appears both in Sutta Nipāta (pp.31-3) and in the Samyutta Nikāya (i.213ff).  The Ālavaka Sutta is also included in the collection of Parittas.[/p][hr][p][b]2.

According to Buddhaghosa (SA.i.225), this was soon after the Buddha's death, shortly before Ānanda became arahant.  People, knowing of his close attendance on the Master, were ever asking for details about the Parinibbāna and when they mourned he had to admonish them.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Ānaka (v.l.  Ānnaka)[/div][p]A mutinga (kettle-drum) belonging to the Dasārahas.  As it grew old and began to split, they fixed in another peg, and this process was continued, until, at last, the original drumhead vanished, leaving only the framework of pegs (S.ii.266).  The origin of the drum is related in the Kakkata Jātaka.  When the Golden Crab, there mentioned, was trampled to death by the elephants, his two claws broke away from his body and lay apart in the Kulīradaha, where he lived.  During the floods the water flowed from the Ganges into this lake, running back again when the floods subsided.  The two claws were thus carried into the Ganges.  One of them reached the sea, and the Asuras, picking it up, made thereof the drum named Ālambara.  The other was picked up by the Ten Royal Brothers (evidently the Dasārahas mentioned above) while playing in the river, and they made of it the little drum Ānaka (J.ii.344; the Jātaka is quoted in SA.ii.167-8, with several variations in detail).[/p][p]In the Samyutta Commentary (ii.167-8) it is said that the drum was like molten wag in colour, because the crab's claw had been dried by wind and sun.  The sound of the drum was heard for twelve leagues, and it was, therefore, used only on festive occasions.  On hearing it, the people assembled hurriedly, in various conveyances, decked with splendour.  It was called Ānaka because it brought the people together as if summoning them (mahājanam pakkositvā viya ānetī ti Ānako).  [/p][p]Later, when the original drumhead had vanished, it could hardly be heard even inside a hall.[/p][p]The Ānaka drum is used as a simile in the Āni Sutta (S.ii.266-7; see also KS.ii.178, n.4).[/p]</e>

The king's gardener, wishing to join in the festivities, approached the king of the monkeys who lived in the royal garden and, pointing out to him all the benefits the monkeys had derived from their residence there, asked him if he would get the monkeys to water the trees in the gardener's absence.  The monkey-king agreed and, when the man had gone, distributed the water-skins and water-pots among the monkeys.  In order that the water should not be wasted, he gave instructions to the monkeys that they should pull out the trees by the roots and give plenty of water to those plans whose roots went deep and little to those with small roots.  A wise man, happening to see this being done, and reflecting how with every desire to do good, the foolish only succeed in doing harm, rebuked the monkey-king.[/p][p]The story was told by the Buddha while staying in a hamlet in Kosala.  The squire of the village invited the Buddha and his monks to a meal and at the conclusion of the meal gave them leave to stroll about in the grounds.

In S.iii.105 Ānanda acknowledges his indebtedness to Punna and gives an account of Punna's sermon to him.[/p][p]During the first twenty years after the Enlightenment, the Buddha did not have the same personal attendants all the time.  From time to time various monks looked after him, among them being  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nagasamala_th,Nāgasamāla')"]Nāgasamāla[/a],  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nagita,Nāgita')"]Nāgita[/a], Upavāna, Sunakkhatta, the novice Cunda, Sāgata, Rādha and Meghiya.  We are told that the Buddha was not particularly pleased with any of them.  At the end of twenty years, at an assembly of the monks, the Buddha declared that he was advanced in years and desired to have somebody as his permanent body-servant, one who would respect his wishes in every way.  The Buddha says that sometimes his attendants would not obey him, and on certain occasions had dropped his bowl and robe and gone away, leaving him.[/p][p]All the great disciples offered their services, but were rejected by the Buddha.  Ānanda alone was left; he sat in silence.  When asked why he did not offer himself, his reply was that the Buddha knew best whom to choose.  When the Buddha signified that he desired to have Ānanda, the latter agreed to accept the post on certain conditions.  The Buddha was never to give him any choice food or garment (*) gotten by him, nor appoint for him a separate "fragrant cell" (residence), nor include him in the invitations accepted by the Buddha.  For, he said, if the Buddha did any of these things, some would say that Ānanda's services to the Buddha were done in order to get clothes, good fare and lodging and be included in the invitations.  Further he was to be allowed to accept invitations on behalf of the Buddha; to bring to the Buddha those who came to see him from afar; to place before the Buddha all his perplexities, and the Buddha was to repeat to him any doctrine taught in his absence.  If these concessions were not granted, he said, some would ask where was the advantage of such service.  Only if these privileges were allowed him would people trust him and realise that the Buddha had real regard for him.  The Buddha agreed to the conditions.[/p][p][/p][blockquote][p](*) Ānanda did, however, accept one of the two robes given by Pukkusa the Mallan to the Buddha (D.ii.133); Buddhaghosa explains this by saying that Ānanda's period of service had now come to an end, and also he wished to be free from the accusation that even after having served the Buddha for twenty-five years, the Buddha had never made him any gift.  It is further stated that Ānanda offered the robe to the Buddha later (DA.ii.570).[/p][/blockquote][p][/p][p]Thenceforth, for twenty-five years (Thag.v.1039), Ānanda waited upon the Buddha, following him like a shadow, bringing him water and toothpick, washing his feet, accompanying him everywhere, sweeping his cell and so forth.  By day he was always at hand, forestalling the Master's slightest wish; at night, stout staff and large torch in hand, he would go nine times round the Buddha's Gandha-kuti in order to keep awake, in case he were needed, and also to prevent the Buddha's sleep from being disturbed.  [/p][p]The account here given is summarised from AA.i.159ff.  and from ThagA.ii.121ff.  On the boons see J.iv.96, where Ānanda had asked for boons in the past too.  The Tibetan sources give a different and interesting version of Ānanda's entry into the Order.  See Rockhill: Life of the Buddha, 57-8.[/p][p]Many examples are given of- Ānanda's solicitude for the Buddha, particularly during the Buddha's last days, as related in the Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta.  Ānanda was the Buddha's equal in age (having been born on the same day), and it is touching to read of this old and most devoted attendant ministering to his eminent cousin, fetching him water, bathing him, rubbing his body, preparing his bed, and receiving last instructions from him on various matters of importance.  It is said that when the Buddha was ill, Ānanda became sympathetically sick (D.ii.99).  He was aware of every change that occurred in the Buddha's body.  E.g., the brightening of his features after Janavasabha's visit (D.ii.204); and the fading of his complexion just before death, which was apparent when the Buddha put on the robe given by Pukkusa (ibid., 133).[/p][p][/p][p]Once, when acting on the instructions of Devadatta, the royal mahouts let loose Nālāgiri, maddened with drink, on the Buddha's path, so that he might trample the Buddha to death, Ānanda, seeing the animal rushing towards them, immediately took his stand in front of the Buddha.  Three times the Buddha forbade him to do so, but Ānanda, usually most obedient, refused to move, and it is said that the Buddha, by his iddhi-power, made the earth roll back in order to get Ānanda out of the elephant's path.  [J.v.335-6; it was in this connection that the Cūlahamsa Jātaka was preached to show that Ānanda had, in previous births also, renounced his life to save that of the Buddha; see also DhA.i.119. The Cullavagga account of the Nālāgiri incident makes no mention of Ānanda's past (Vin.ii.195)].  [/p][p][/p][p]Sometimes, the extreme zealousness of Ānanda drew on him the Buddha's rebuke - e.g., when he prepared tekatuka gruel (gruel with three kinds of pungent substances) for the Buddha when he was suffering from wind in the stomach.  The gruel was prepared from food kept indoors and was cooked by Ānanda himself, indoors; this was against the rules (Vin.i.210-11), but Ānanda knew that the gruel would cure the Buddha.[/p][p][/p][p]Ānanda was most efficient in the performance of the numerous duties attached to his post.  Whenever the Buddha wished to summon the monks or to send a message to anyone, it was to Ānanda that he entrusted the task.  See, e.g., D.ii.199; 147; Vin.i.80; M.i.456.[/p][p]He reported to the Buddha any news which he beard and thought interesting.  E.g., the death of Nigantha Nātaputta, of which he learnt from Cunda Samanuddesa (D.iii.118; M.ii.244); also Devadatta's conspiracy to harm the Buddha (Vin.ii.198).  [/p][p]Laymen and laywomen, wishing to give alms to the Buddha and the monks, would often consult him in their difficulties, and he would always advise them.  E.g., the Andhakavinda Brāhmana (Vin.i.220-1); Roja the Malla (ibid., 248); see also ibid., 238f.[/p][p]When the monks came to him expressing their desire to hear the Buddha preach, he did his best to grant their wish.  E.g. when the Buddha retired into the Pārileyya forest (S.iii.95; DhA.i.50f.).[/p][p][/p][p]Sometimes when Ānanda felt that an interview with the Buddha would be of use to certain people, he would contrive that the Buddha should talk to them and solve their doubts; thus, for instance, he arranged an interview for the Nigantha Saccaka (M.i.237) and the brahmins Sangārava and Rammaka (S.i.163; M.i.161).  Similarly he took Samiddhi to the Buddha when he found that Samiddhi had wrongly represented the Buddha's views (M.iii.208).  When he discovered that Kimbila and a large number of other monks would greatly benefit if the Buddha would preach to them on ānāpānasati, he requested the Buddha that he should do so.  (S.v.323).  Ānanda's requests were, however, not always granted.  Once, for instance, though he asked the Buddha three times to recite the Pātimokkha, the Buddha refused to do so until an offending monk had been removed (Vin.ii.236f.).[/p][p]Again, when at Vesāli, as a result of the Buddha's talks to the monks on asubha, a large number of them, feeling shame and loathing for their bodies, committed suicide, Ānanda suggested to the Buddha that he might teach the monks some method by which they might obtain insight (aññā) (S.v.320f).[/p][p][/p][p]In order that people might still worship the Buddha when he was away on tour, Ānanda planted the Ānanda-Bodhi (q.v.).[/p][p]Ānanda was, however, careful that people should not weary the Buddha unnecessarily.  Even when he told the Buddha about the suicide of the monks (mentioned above), he was careful to wait till the Buddha had finished his fortnight's solitude, because he had given orders that he should not be disturbed.[/p][p][/p][p]When Subhadda wanted to see the Buddha as he lay on his death-bed, Ānanda refused to let him in until expressly asked to do so by the Master (D.ii.149).  That same day when the Mallas of Kusinārā came with their families to pay their last respects to the Buddha, Ānanda arranged them in groups, and introduced each group so that the ceremony might be gone through without delay (D.ii.148).[/p][p][/p][p]He often saved the Buddha from unpleasantness by preventing too pious admirers from trying to persuade the Buddha to do what was against his scruples.  E.g., Bodhirājakumāra, when he asked the Buddha to walk over the carpets in his mansion, Kokanada (Vin.ii.128; M.ii.94).[/p][p][/p][p]Among Ānanda's duties was the task of going round to put away anything which might have been forgotten by anyone in the congregation after hearing the Buddha preach (DhA.i.410).[/p][p][/p][p]Ānanda was often consulted by colleagues on their various difficulties.  Thus we find Vangīsa (S.i.188; Thag.vers.1223-6) confiding to him his restlessness at the sight of women and asking for his advice.  Among others who came to him with questions on various doctrinal matters were Kāmabhū (S.iv.165-6), Udāyi (S.v.166-8; A.iv.449), Channa (S.iii.133-4), and Bhadda (S.v.171-3; ThagA.i.474; he could not, however, be of use to his fellow celibate Bhandu).  Nor were these consultations confined to his fellow-monks, for we find the brahmins Ghosita (S.iv.113) and Unnābha (S.v.272), the Licchavis Abhaya and Panditakumāraka (A.i.220), the paribbājakas Channa (A.i.215) and Kokanuda (A.v.196), the upāsikā Migasālā (A.iii.347, and again A.v.137), a householder of Kosambī (A.i.217) and Pasenadi Kosala (M.ii.112), all coming to him for enlightenment and instruction.  It was on this occasion that Pasenadi presented Ānanda with a valuable piece of foreign material which had been sent to him by Ajātasattu.  [/p][p]Sometimes the monks, having heard a brief sermon from the Buddha, would seek out Ānanda to obtain from him a more detailed exposition, for he had the reputation of being able to expound the Dhamma (A.v.225; S.iv.93).[/p][p][/p][p]It is said that the Buddha would often deliberately shorten his discourse to the monks so that they might be tempted to have it further explained by Ānanda.  They would then return to the Buddha and report to him Ānanda's exposition, which would give him an opportunity of praising Ānanda's erudition.  MA.i.81; for such praise see, e.g., A.v.229. It is said that once when a certain landowner asked the Buddha how he could show honour to the Dhamma, the Buddha told him to show honour to Ānanda if he wished to honour the Dhamma (J.iv.369).  [/p][p][/p][p]In the Sekha Sutta (M.i.353ff ) we are told that after the Buddha had preached to the Sākiyans of Kapilavatthu till late at night, he asked Ānanda to continue the discourse while he himself rested.  Ānanda did so, and when the Buddha awoke after his sleep, he commended Ānanda on his ability.  On another occasion, the Buddha asks Ānanda to address the monks on the wonders attendant on a Buddha's birth, and the Acchari-yabbhuta-Dhamma Sutta is the result.  The Buddha is mentioned as listening with approval (M.iii.119ff).[/p][p][/p][p]Sometimes Ānanda would suggest to the Buddha a simile to be used in his discourse, e.g.  the Dhammayāna simile (S.v.5); or by a simile suggest a name to be given to a discourse, e.g.  the Madhupindika Sutta (M.i.114; cp.  Upavāna suggesting the name for the Pāsādika Sutta D.iii.141); or again, particularly wishing to remember a certain Sutta, he would ask the Buddha to give it a name, e.g.  the Bahudhātuka Sutta (M.iii.67).[/p][p][/p][p]Several instances occur of Ānanda preaching to the monks of his own accord (E.g., A.ii.156f.; v.6) and also to the laity (E.g., A.ii.194).  The Sandaka Sutta records a visit paid by Ānanda with his followers to the paribbajaka Sandaka, and describes how he won Sandaka over by a discourse.  Sometimes, as in the case of the Bhaddekaratta Sutta (M.iii.189f ) Ānanda would repeat to the assembly of monks a sermon which he had previously heard the Buddha preach.  Ānanda took the fullest advantage of the permission granted to him by the Buddha of asking him any question he desired.  He had a very inquiring mind; if the Buddha smiled he would ask the reason (M.ii.45, 50, 74; A.iii.214f.; J.iii.405; iv.7).[/p][p]Or if he remained silent, Ānanda had to be told the reason (S.iv.400).  He knew that the Buddha did nothing without definite cause; when Upavāna, who stood fanning the Buddha, was asked to move away, Ānanda wished to know the reason, and was told that Upavāna prevented various spirits from seeing the Buddha (D.ii.139).  The Buddha was always willing to answer Ānanda's questions to his satisfaction.  Sometimes, as in the case of his question regarding the dead citizens of Ñātikā (D.ii.91ff.),* a long discourse would result.**[/p][blockquote][p]* In this case the discourse concluded with a description of the Dhammādāsa (Mirror of Truth) to be used for all time; see also S.v.356-60.[/p][p]** The Pabbajjā Sutta (Sn.72ff.), was preached because of Ānanda's request that the Buddha should give an account of his renunciation (SnA.ii.381); see also Pubbayogāvacara Sutta (SnA.i.47).[/p][/blockquote][p]Most often his consultations with the Buddha were on matters of doctrine or were connected with it - e.g., on nirodha (S.iii.24); loka (S.iv.53); suñña (S.iv.54; M.iii.104-24); vedanā (S.iv.219-21) ; iddhi (S.v.282-4; 286); ānāpānasati (S.v.328-34); bhava, etc.  (A.i.223f.); on the chalabhijāti of Pūrana Kassapa (q.v.); the aims and purposes of sīla (A.v.1f., repeated in v.311f.); the possibilities of samādhi (A.v.7f., repeated in v.318 and in A.i.132f.); on sanghabheda (A.v.75ff.); the qualities requisite to be a counsellor of monks (A.iv.279ff.); the power of carrying possessed by a Buddha's voice (A.i.226f.); the conditions necessary for a monk's happiness (A.iii.132f.); the different ways of mastering the elements (M.iii.62f.); the birthplace of "noble men" (DhA.iii.248); and the manner in which previous Buddhas kept the Fast-day (DhA.iii.246).  To these should be added the conversations on numerous topics recorded in the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta.  Some of these questions - e.g., about earthquakes (D.ii.107ff.; A.iv.312ff.) and the different kinds of spirits present at the death of the Buddha (D.ii.139f.) - seem to have been put into Ānanda's mouth in order that they might be used as pegs on which to hang beliefs connected with them which were current among later-day Buddhists.[/p][p][/p][p]Not all the Suttas addressed to Ānanda are, however, the result of his questions.  Sometimes he would repeat to the Buddha conversations he had had with others and talks he had overheard, and the Buddha would expound in detail the topics occurring therein.[/p][p][/p][p]Thus, for instance, a conversation with Pasenadi Kosala on Kalyānamittatā is repeated and the Buddha explains its importance (S.i.87-9; v.2-3) ; Ānanda tells the Buddha about his visit to the Paribbajakārāma in Kosambi and what he there heard about a bhikkhu being called niddasa after twelve years of celibacy.  The Buddha thereupon expounds the seven niddasavatthu (A.iv.37ff.).  The account conveyed by Ānanda of Udāyī preaching to a large crowd leads to an exposition of the difficulties of addressing large assemblies and the qualities needed to please them (A.iii.184).  A conversation between Udāyī and the carpenter Pañcakanga on feelings is overheard by Ānanda and reported to the Buddha, who gives a detailed explanation of his views on the subject (S.iv.222f.; M.i.397f.).  The same thing happens when Ānanda mentions to the Buddha talks he had heard between Sāriputta and the Pāribbājakas (S.ii.35-7) and between the same Elder and Bhūmiya (S.ii.39-41).  Sometimes - as in the case of the upāsikā Migasālā (A.iii.347; v.137) - Ānanda would answer questions put to him as best he could, and seek the Buddha's advice and corrections of his interpretation of the Doctrine.[/p][p][/p][p]When the monks asked Ānanda whether the Buddha's predictions regarding the results of Devadatta's crimes were based on actual knowledge, he furnished them with no answer at all until he had consulted the Buddha (A.iii.402).  Similarly, when Tapussa questions him as to why household life is not attractive to laymen, Ānanda takes him straight away to the Buddha, who is spending his siesta in the Mahāvana in Uruvelakappa (A.iv.438f.).  Once Ānanda fancies that he knows all about causation, and tells the Buddha how glad he is that he should understand this difficult subject.  The Buddha points out to him that he really knows very little about it and preaches to him the Mahānidāna Sutta (D.ii.55ff.; S.ii.92-3).[/p][p]When Ānanda realises that the Buddha will die in a short while, with childlike simplicity, he requests the Buddha to make a last pronouncement regarding the Order (D.ii[st2:frenchfranctoeuro ProductID=".98 ff"].98 ff[/st2:frenchfranctoeuro].; S.v.152-4).[/p][p][/p][p]On several occasions it is news that Ānanda brings to the Buddha - e.g., about the death of the Nigantha Nātaputta, and about Devadatta's plots, already mentioned - which provoke the Buddha to preach to him: Phagguna has died, and at his death his senses seemed very clear; so they would, says the Buddha, and proceeds to speak of the advantages of listening to the Dhamma in due season (A.iii.381f.).  Or again, Girimānanda is ill and would the Buddha go and see him? The Buddha suggests that Ānanda should go and tell Girimānanda about the ten kinds of saññā (aniccasññā, etc.), and the patient will recover (A.v.108f.).  Ānanda desires to retire into solitude and develop zeal and energy; would the Buddha tell him on which topics to meditate? And the Buddha preaches to him the doctrine of impermanence (S.iii.187; iv.54-5).[/p][p][/p][p]The Buddha, however, often preached to Ānanda without any such provocation on various topics - e.g., on the nature of the sahkhāra (S.iii.3740); on the impossibility of the monk without faith attaining eminence in the sāsana (A.v.152ff.); on the power the Buddha has of knowing which doctrines would appeal to different people and of preaching accordingly (A.v.36f.); on immorality and its consequences (A.i.50f.); on the admonitions that should be addressed to new entrants to the Order (A.iii.138f.); on the advice which should be given to friends by those desiring their welfare (A.i.222).[/p][p][/p][p]The various topics on which the Buddha discoursed to Ānanda as recorded in the Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta, have already been referred to.  Some of them - e.g., on the eight assemblies, the eight positions of mastery, the eight stages of deliverance (D.ii.112) - seem to be stereotyped later additions.  On the other hand, with regard to the accounts of the honours to be paid to a Buddha's dead body, the places of pilgrimage for the pious, and various other similar subjects, it is impossible to say how far they are authentic.  In a few instances the remarks addressed to Ānanda seem to be meant for others, to be heard by them or to be conveyed to them - e.g., in the dispute between Udāyī and Sāriputta, when they both seek the Buddha for him to settle the differences in opinion between them (A.iii.192ff.); or, again, when the recalcitrant Udāyī fails to answer the Buddha's question on subjects of reflection (anussatitthāna), and Ānanda gives an answer which the Buddha approves (A.iii.322ff.).  A question asked by Ānanda as to whether there are any scents which spread even against the wind, results in the well-known sermon about the fame of the holy man being wafted everywhere (A.i.222f.; DhA.i.420ff.).  Once or twice Ānanda intervenes in a discussion between the Buddha and another, either to ask a question or to suggest a simile which he feels could help the Buddha in establishing his point - e.g., in the interviews of Uttiya Paribbājaka (A.v.194), of the brahmin Sangārava (A.i.169), and again of Vidūdabha, son of Pasenadi (M.ii.130).[/p][p][/p][p]In the Mahā Mālunkyā Sutta (M.i.433), it is Ānanda's intervention which evokes the discourse on the Five Fetters.  Similarly he intervenes in a discussion between the Buddha and Pārāsariya's pupil, Uttara, and persuades the Buddha to preach the Indriyabhāvanā Sutta on the cultivation of the Faculties (M.iii.298ff.).[/p][p]Buddhaghosa gives a list of the discourses which bring out the eminence and skill of Ānanda; they are the Sekha, Bāhitiya, Ānañjasappāya, Gopaka-Moggallāna, Bahudhātuka, Cūlasuññata, Mahāsuññata, Acchariyabbhuta, Bhaddekaratta, Mahānidā-na, Mahāparinibbāna, Subha and Cūlaniyalokadhātu.  (For particulars of these see under the respective names.) The books give accounts of several conversations between Ānanda and his eminent colleagues, such as Sāriputta.  See also his conversation with Musīla, and Savittha and Nārada at Kosambī in the Ghositārāma (S.ii.113f.).  He seems to have felt happy in their company and did not hesitate to take to them his difficulties; thus we find him asking Sāriputta why only certain beings in this world reach parinibbāna (A.ii.167); on another occasion he asks Sāriputta about the possibilities of samādhi (A.v.8).  On the other hand, at least twice (A.iii.201f.; 361f.), when Ānanda asks his questions of Sāriputta, the latter suggests that Ānanda himself should find the answer, and having heard it, Sāriputta praises him highly and extols his abilities.[/p][p][/p][p]Ānanda's special friends seem to have been Sāriputta, Moggallāna, Mahā Kassapa, Anuruddha and Kankhā Revata (E.g., M.i.212f).  He was the Sangha-navaka among them all, yet they held him in high esteem (MA.i.436).  Ānanda and Sāriputta were very special friends.  It is said that Sāriputta loved Ānanda because the latter did for the Buddha what Sāriputta would wish to have done himself, and Ānanda respected Sāriputta because he was the Buddha's chief disciple.  Young men who were ordained by either of them would be sent to the other to learn under him.  They shared between them any good thing given to them.  Once Ānanda was presented by a brahmin with a costly robe; immediately he wished to give it to Sāriputta, but as the latter was away at the time, he obtained the Buddha's permission to keep it for him till his return (Vin.i.289; Sp.iii.636-7; MA.i.436).[/p][p]The Samyutta Nikāya (i.63-4) contains an eulogy on Sāriputta by Ānanda, where the latter speaks of his comprehensive and manifold wisdom, joyous and swift, of his rampant energy and readiness to accept advice.  When he hears of Sāriputta's death from Cunda the Samanuddesa, he goes to the Buddha with Cunda (not wishing to break the news himself) and they take with them Sāriputta's bowl and outer robe, Cunda carrying the ashes, and there Ānanda confesses to the Buddha that when he heard the news he felt as thought his body were drugged, his senses confused and his mind become a blank (S.v.161; Thag.vers.1034-5).  The Commentary adds (SA.i.180) that Ānanda was trembling "like a cock escaping from the mouth of a cat."[/p][p]That Mahā Kassapa was fond of Ānanda, we may gather from the fact that it was he who contrived to have him elected on the First Council, and when Mahā Kassapa heard of Ānanda's attainment of arahantship, it was he who led the applause (DA.i.11).  Ānanda held him in the highest veneration, and on one occasion refused to take part in an upasampadā ordination because he would have to pronounce Kassapa's name and did not consider this respectful towards the Elder (Vin.i.92).  In their conversations, Kassapa addresses Ānanda as "āvuso", Ānanda addresses Kassapa as "bhante." There is an interview recorded between them in which Kassapa roundly abuses Ānanda, calling him- corn-trampler" and "despoiler of families," and he ends by up saying , this boy does not know his own measure." Ānanda had been touring Dahkhinagiri with a large company of monks, mostly youths, and the latter had not brought much credit upon them selves.  When Kassapa sees Ānanda on his return to Rājagaha, he puts on him the whole blame for the youths' want of training.  Ānanda winces at being called "boy"; , my head is growing grey hairs, your reverence, yet I am not vexed that you should call me 'boy' even at this time of day." Thullanandā heard of this incident and showed great annoyance.  "How dare Mahā Kassapa," she says, "who was once a heretical teacher, chide the sage Ānanda, calling him 'boy'?" Mahā Kassapa complains to Ānanda of Thullanandā's behaviour; probably, though we are not told so, Ānanda apologised to him on her behalf (S.ii.217ff).[/p][p][/p][p]On another occasion, Ānanda, after a great deal of persuasion, took Kassapa to a settlement of the nuns.  There Kassapa preached to them, but the nun Thullatissā was not pleased and gave vent publicly to her displeasure.  "How does Kassapa think it fit to preach the doctrine in the presence of the learned sage Ānanda? It is as if the needle-pedlar were to deem he could sell a needle to the needle-maker." Kassapa is incensed at these words, but Ānanda appeases him by acknowledging that he (Kassapa) is in every way his superior and asks him to pardon Tissa.  "Be indulgent, your reverence," says he, "women are foolish." S.ii.215ff.; the Tibetans say that when Kassapa died, Ajātasattu was very grieved because he had not been able to see the monk's body.  Ānanda took the king to the mountain where it had been buried and showed it to him (Rockhill, op.  cit., p.162 and n.2).[/p][p]In this passage Ānanda is spoken of as Vedehamuni.  The Commentary (SA.ii.132) explains it by panditamuni, and says further, pandito hi ñānasankhātena vedena īhati sabbakiccāni karoti, tasmā vedeho ti vuccati ; vedeho ca so muni cā ti vedehamuni.  Compare with this the derivation of Vedehiputta in connection with Ajātasattu.  See also Vedehikā.  The Mtu.  (iii.176-7) says that when the Buddha went away from home Ānanda wished to join him, but his mother was unwilling, because his brother, Devadatta, had already gone away.  Ānanda therefore went to the Videha country and became a muni.  Is this another explanation of the term Vedehamuni?[/p][p][/p][p]It was perhaps Ānanda's championship of the women's cause which made him popular with the nuns and earned for him a reputation rivalling, as was mentioned above, even that of Mahā Kassapa.  When Pajāpatī Gotamī, with a number of Sākyan women, undaunted by the Buddha's refusal of their request at Kapilavatthu, followed him into Vesāli and there beseeched his consent for women to enter the Order, the Buddha would not change his mind.[/p][p]Ānanda found the women dejected and weeping, with swollen feet, standing outside the Kūtāgārasālā.  Having learnt what had happened, he asked the Buddha to grant their request.  Three times he asked and three times the Buddha refused.  Then he changed his tactics.  He inquired of the Buddha if women were at all capable of attaining the Fruits of the Path.  The answer was in the affirmative, and Ānanda pushed home the advantage thus gained.  In the end the Buddha allowed women to enter the Order subject to certain conditions.  They expressed their great gratitude to Ānanda (Vin.ii.253ff.  Ānanda is again found as intermediary for Pajāpatī Gotamī in M.iii.253f).  In this connection, the Buddha is reported as having said (Vin.ii.256) that had Ānanda not persuaded him to give his consent to the admission of women to the Order, the Sāsana would have lasted a thousand years, but now it would last only five hundred.[/p][p]This championing of the women's cause was also one of the charges brought against Ānanda by his colleagues at the end of the First Council.  (See below.)[/p][p]Perhaps it was this solicitude for their privileges that prompted him to ask the Buddha one day why it was that women did not sit in public assemblies (e.g.  courts of justice), or embark on business, or reap the full fruit of their actions (A.ii.82. See also GS.ii.92, n.2, on the interpretation of the last word).[/p][p]That Ānanda was in the habit of preaching frequently to the nuns is evident from the incidents quoted above and also from other passages (E.g., S.v.154ff.; Thag.v.1020; ThagA.ii.129).  He seems also to have been in charge of the arrangements for sending preachers regularly to the nuns.  A passage in the Samyutta Commentary (i.210) seems to indicate that Ānanda was a popular preacher among laywomen as well.[/p][p]They would stand round him when he preached, fanning him and asking him questions on the Dhamma.  When he went to Kosambī to impose the higher penalty on Channa, the women of King Udena's harem, hearing of his presence in the park, came to him and listened to his preaching.  So impressed were they that they gave him five hundred robes (Vin.ii.290).  It was on this occasion that Ānanda convinced Udena of the conscientiousness with which the Sākyaputta monks used everything which was given to them, wasting nothing.  The king, pleased with Ānanda, gave him another five hundred robes, all of which he distributed among the community.  [/p][p]Ananda had been a tailor in a past birth and had given a Pacceka Buddha a piece of cloth, the size of his hand, and a needle.  Because of the gift of the needle he was wise, because of the cloth he got 500 robes (AA.i.239).[/p][p]A similar story is related of the women of Pasenadi's palace and their gift to Ānanda.  The king was at first angry, but afterwards gave Ānanda one thousand robes (J.ii.24ff).[/p][p][/p][p]The Dhammapada Commentary (i.382ff ) says that once Pasenadi asked the Buddha to go regularly to the palace with five hundred monks and preach the Law to his queens Mallikā and Vāsabhakhattiyā and to the other women in the palace.  When the Buddha said that it was impossible for him to go regularly to one place he was asked to send a monk, and the duty was assigned to Ānanda.  He therefore went to the palace at stated times and instructed the queens.  Mallikā was found to be a good student, but not so Vāsabhakhattiyā.[/p][p][/p][p]The Jātaka Commentary (i.382) says that the women of the palace were themselves asked which of the eighty chief disciples they would have as their preacher and they unanimously chose Ānanda.  For an incident connected with Ānanda's visits to the palace see the Mahāsāra Jātaka and also Pasenadi.[/p][p]According to the Anguttara Commentary (ii.533) Ānanda was beautiful to look at.[/p][p]Ānanda's services seem often to have been sought for consoling the sick.  Thus we find Anāthapindika sending for him when he lay ill (M.iii.258), and also Sirivaddha (S.v.176f) and Mānadinna (S.v.177f).  He is elsewhere mentioned as helping the Buddha to wait on a sick monk (Vin.i.302).  We are told that when the Buddha had his afternoon siesta, Ānanda would spend his time in waiting upon the sick and talking to them (Sp.iii.651).  Ānanda was never too busy to show gratitude to his friends.  When a certain crow-keeper's family, members of which had been of special service to him, had been destroyed by a pestilence, leaving only two very young boys, he obtained the Buddha's special permission to ordain them and look after them, though they were under the requisite age.  (Vin.i.79; to a young monk who used to wait on him and do various services for him, Ānanda gave five hundred robes presented to him by Pasenadi; the monk distributed them to his colleagues).[/p][p]When Ānanda discovered that his friend Roja and Malla had no real faith in the Buddha, he was greatly grieved and interceded on his special behalf with the Buddha that he should make Roja a believer.  Later he obtained the Buddha's permission for Roja to offer a meal of potherbs (Vin.i.247-9).  In another place we find Roja presenting Ānanda with a linen cloth (Vin.i.296).  According to the Jātakatthakathā (ii.231) Roja once tried to persuade Ānanda to go back to the lay-life.[/p][p]His sympathy is also shown in the story of the woman who asked to have a share in the Vihāra built by Visākhā.  She brought a costly carpet, but could find no place in which to put it; it looked so poor beside the other furnishings.  Ānanda helped her in her disappointment (DhA.i.415f).[/p][p]Once in Jetavana, in an assembly of monks, the Buddha spoke the praises of Ānanda, and ranked him the foremost bhikkhu in five respects: erudition, good behaviour (gatimantānam, power of walking, according to Dhammapāla), retentive memory, resoluteness and personal attention (A.i.24f).  Again, shortly before the Buddha's death, he speaks affectionately of Ānanda (D.ii.144-5; A.ii.132; A.v.229; SA.ii.94f ); Ānanda knew the right time to bring visitors to the Tathāgata; he had four exceptional qualities, in that whoever came to see him, monks or nuns, laymen or laywomen, they were all filled with joy on beholding him; when he preached to them they listened with rapture and delight, which never tired.  He was called Ānanda because he brought joy to his kinsmen (ThagA.ii.123).[/p][p]But see the story of Atula (DhA.iii.327), who is not satisfied with Ānanda's preaching.[/p][p]Another proof of the Buddha's esteem for Ānanda is the incident of his asking Ānanda to design a robe for the monks to be in pattern like a field in Magadha (Vin.i.287).[/p][p][/p][p]In spite of Ānanda having been the constant companion of the Buddha - probably because of that very fact - it was not until after the Buddha's parinibbāna that Ānanda was able to realise Arahantship.  Buddhaghosa gives a long account of Ānanda's struggle for final emancipation (DA.i.9ff.); see also Vin.ii.286. Though he was not an arahant he had the patisambhidā, being among the few who possessed this qualification while yet learners (Sekhā) ( VibhA.388).  When it was decided by Mahā Kassapa and others that a Convocation should be held to systematise the Buddha's teachings, five hundred monks were chosen as delegates, among them, Ānanda.  He was, however, the only non-arahant (sekha) among them, and he had been enjoined by his colleagues to put forth great effort and repair this disqualification.  At length, when the convocation assembled, a vacant seat had to be left for him.  It had not been until late the previous night that, after a final supreme effort, he had attained the goal.  He had been occupied in consoling the laity after the Buddha's death and had had no time for practising meditation.  In the end it was a devatā in the woodland grove in Kosala, where he was staying, who pointed out the urgency of the matter (S.i.199-200); but see ThagA.i.237, where the credit for this is given to a Vajjiputta thera.[/p][p]It is said that he won sixfold abhiññā when he was just lying down to sleep, his head hardly on the pillow, his feet hardly off the ground.  He is therefore described as having become an arahant in none of the four postures.  When he appeared in the convocation, Mahā Kassapa welcomed him warmly and shouted three times for joy.  According to the Majjhimabhānakā, says Buddhaghosa, Ānanda appeared on his seat while the others looked on, having come through the earth; according to others he came through the air.  According to ThagA.ii.130, it was a Brahmā of the Suddhāvāsa who announced Ānanda's attainment of arahantship to his colleagues at the Convocation.  [/p][p]In the convocation, Ānanda was appointed to answer Mahā Kassapa's questions, and to co-operate with him in rehearsing the Dhamma (as opposed to the Vinaya).[/p][p]Ānanda came to be known as Dhammabhandāgārika, owing to his skill in remembering the word of the Buddha; it is said that he could remember everything spoken by the Buddha, from one to sixty thousand words in the right order; and without missing one single syllable (ThagA.ii.134).[/p][p]In the first four Nikāyas of the Sutta Pitaka, every sutta begins with the words "Thus have I heard," the "I" referring to Ānanda.  It is not stated that Ānanda was present at the preaching by the Buddha of every sutta, though he was present at most; others, the Buddha repeated to him afterwards, in accordance with the conditions under which he had become the Buddha's attendant.[/p][p]We are told that Ānanda had learnt eighty-two thousand dhamma (topics) from the Buddha himself and two thousand from his colleagues (Thag.v.1024).  He had also a reputation for fast talking; where an ordinary man could speak one word Ānanda could speak eight; the Buddha could speak sixteen words for each one word of Ānanda (MA.i.283).  Ānanda could remember anything he had once heard up to fifteen thousand stanzas of sixty thousand lines (MA.i.501).[/p][p]Ānanda lived to be very old (one hundred and twenty years, says DhA.ii.99; he is bracketed with Bakkula, as having lived to a great age, AA.ii.596); a hymn of praise sung at his death is included at the end of the stanzas attributed to him in the Theragāthā (Vers.1047-9).  That the Buddha's death was a great blow to him is shown by the stanzas he uttered immediately after the event (D.ii.157).  Three months earlier he had heard for the first time that death of the Buddha was near at hand and had besought him to live longer.  The reply attributed to the Buddha is a curious one, namely, that on several previous occasions, at Rājagaha and at Vesālī (See, e.g., D.102f), he had mentioned to Ānanda that he could, if he so desired, live for a whole kappa, and had hinted that Ānanda should, if he felt so inclined, request him to prolong his life.  Ānanda, however, having failed to take the hint on these occasions, the opportunity was now past, and the Buddha must die; the fault was entirely Ānanda's (Ibid., 114-18).  It was when Ānanda was temporarily absent from the Buddha's side that the Buddha had assured Māra that he would die in three months (Ibid., 105-6).[/p][p]As the end approached, the Buddha noticed that Ānanda was not by his side; on enquiry he learnt that Ānanda was outside, weeping and filled with despair at the thought that the Master would soon be no more, and that he (Ānanda) would have to work out his perfection unaided.  The Buddha sent for him and consoled him by pointing out that whatever is born must, by its very nature, be dissolved.  Three times he said, "For a long time, Ānanda, you have been very near to me by acts of love, kind and good, never varying, beyond all measure," and he exhorted him to be earnest in effort, for he would soon realise emancipation.  (Ibid., 144).  It was on this occasion that the Palāsa Jātaka was preached (J.iii.23ff.).[/p][p]Once, earlier, when Udāyi had teased Ānanda for not having benefited from his close association with the personality of the Master, the Buddha had defended Ānanda, saying, "Say not so, Udāyi; should he die without attaining perfect freedom from passion, by virtue of his piety, he would seven times win rule over the devas and seven times be King of Jambudīpa.  Howbeit, in this very life shall Ānanda attain to Nibbāna.  A.i.228.[/p][p][/p][p]Ānanda did his best to persuade the Buddha to die in one of the great cities, such as Rājagaha or Sāvatthi, and not in Kusinārā, the little wattle-and-daub town (as he called it) in the middle of the jungle.  He was not satisfied until the Buddha had revealed to him the past history of Kusinārā, how it had once been Kusāvatī, the royal capital of the mighty Mahā Sudassana (D.ii.146).[/p][p]Just before the Buddha died, Ānanda was commissioned to inform the Mallas of the impending event, and after the Buddha's death, Anuruddha entrusted him, with the help of the Mallas of Kusināāa, with all the arrangements for the funeral (D.ii.158ff).  Ānanda had earlier (D.ii.141f) learnt from the Buddha how the remains of a Tathāgata should be treated, and now he was to benefit by the instruction.[/p][p]At the end of the First Council, the duty of handing down unimpaired the Digha Nikāya through his disciples was entrusted to Ānanda (DA.i.15).  He was also charged with the duty of conveying to Channa the news that the higher penalty (brahmadanda) had been inflicted on him by the Sangha.  Ānanda had been deputed by the Buddha himself to carry out this, his last administrative act (D.ii.154), but Ānanda, not wishing to undertake the responsibility alone (knowing that Channa had a reputation for roughness), was granted a number of companions, with whom he visited Channa.  The latter expressed repentance and was pardoned (Vin.ii.290-2).  Perhaps it was because both the Buddha and Ānanda's colleagues knew of his power to settle disputes that he was chosen for this delicate task.  See S.ii.235f., where the Buddha classes him with Sāriputta and Moggallāna for his ability to settle disputes among the monks.[/p][p]Ānanda's popularity, however, did not save him from the recriminations of his fellows for some of his actions, which, in their eyes, constituted offences.  Thus he was charged (Vin.ii.288-9) with: (1) having failed to find out from the Buddha which were the lesser and minor precepts which the Sangha were allowed to revoke if they thought fit (See D.ii.154); (2) with having stepped on the Buddha's rainy-season garment when sewing it; (3) with having allowed the Buddha's body to be first saluted by women (not mentioned elsewhere, but see Rockhill, op.  cit., p.154); (4) with having omitted to ask the Buddha to live on for the space of a kappa (D.ii.115); and (5) with having exerted himself to procure the admission of women into the Order (Vin.ii.253).[/p][p]Ānanda's reply was that he himself saw no fault in any of these acts, but that he would confess them as faults out of faith in his colleagues.[/p][p][/p][p]On another occasion he was found fault with (1) for having gone into the village to beg for alms, clothed in his waist-cloth and nether garment (Vin.i.298); (2) for having worn light garments which were blown about by the wind (Vin.ii.136).[/p][p]The last years of his life, Ānanda seems to have spent in teaching and preaching and in encouraging his younger colleagues.  Among those who held discussions with him after the Buddha's passing away are mentioned Dasama of the Atthakanagara (M.i.349f), Gopaka Moggallāna (M.iii.7; Thag.ver.1024) and Subha Todeyyaputta (D.i.204ff).[/p][p]The Pāli Canon makes no mention of Ānanda's death.  Fa Hsien (Giles trans.  44. The story also occurs in DhA.ii.99ff., with several variations in detail), however, relates what was probably an old tradition.  When Ānanda was on his way from Magadha to Vesāli, there to die, Ajātasattu heard that he was coming, and, with his retinue, followed him up to the Rohini River.  The chiefs of Vesali also heard the news and went out to meet him, and both parties reached the river banks.  Ānanda, not wishing to incur the displeasure of either party, entered into the state of tejokasina in the middle of the river and his body went up in flames.  His remains were divided into two portions, one for each party, and they built cetiyas for their enshrinement (See also Rockhill, op.  cit., 165f).[/p][p]In the time of Padumuttara Buddha Ānanda had been the son of Ānanda, King of Hamsavatī, and was therefore a step-brother of Padumuttara.  His name was Sumana.  King Ānanda allowed no one but himself to wait on the Buddha.  Prince Sumana having quelled an insurrection of the frontier provinces, the king offered him a boon as reward, and he asked to be allowed to entertain the Buddha and his monks for three months.  With great reluctance the king agreed, provided the Buddha's consent was obtained.  When Sumana went to the vihāra to obtain this, he was greatly impressed by the loyalty and devotion of the Buddha's personal attendant, the monk Sumana, and by his iddhi-powers.  Having learnt from the Buddha that these were the result of good deeds, he himself determined to lead a pious life.  For the Buddha's residence Prince Sumana bought a pleasaunce named Sobhana from a householder of that same name and built therein a monastery costing one hundred thousand.  On the way from the capital to Sobhana Park he built vihāras, at distances of a league from each other.  When all preparations were completed, the Buddha went to Sobhana with one hundred thousand monks, stopping at each vihāra on the way.  At the festival of dedication of the Sobhana Vihāra, Sumana expressed a wish to become a personal attendant of a future Buddha, just as Sumana was of Padumuttara.  Towards this end he did many good deeds.  In the time of Kassapa Buddha he gave his upper garment to a monk for him to carry his begging-bowl in it.  Later he was born in heaven and again as King of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"]Benares[/a].  He built for eight Pacceka Buddhas eight monasteries in his royal park (ThagA.ii.121ff) and for ten thousand years he looked after them.  The Apadāna mentions (i.52f) that he became ruler of heaven thirty-four times and king of men fifty-eight times.[/p][p][/p][p]Ānanda's name occurs in innumerable Jātakas; he is identified with [/p][ul][li][p]Suriyakumāra in the Devadhamma Jātaka (i.133), [/li][li][p]Cullalohita in the Munika (i.198), [/li][li][p]Pajjuna in the Maccha (i.332), [/li][li][p]Kālakanni in the Kālakanni (i.365), [/li][li][p]Rādha in the Rādha (i.496), [/li][li][p]Potthapāda in the Rādha II.

As a result, he suffered in hell for a long time and was born for fourteen existences as some one's wife, and it was seven existences more before the results of his evil deed were exhausted.[/p][p][/p][p]There seems to be some confusion as to the time at which Ānanda entered the Order.  In the Canonical account (E.g., Vin.ii.182) he became a monk in the second year of the Buddha's ministry.  In the verses attributed to him in the Theragātha (Vers.1039ff), however, he says that he has been for twenty five years a learner (sekha).  It is concluded from this that Ānanda must have joined the Order only in the twentieth year after the Enlightenment and the whole story of his having been ordained at the same time as Devadatta is discredited.  (See, e.g., Thomas: op.  cit., 123. See also Rhys Davids' article on Devadatta in ERE).  The verses occur in a lament by Ānanda that his master is dead and that he is yet a learner.  The twenty-five years which Ānanda mentions probably refer to the period during which he had been the Buddha's personal attendant and not to his whole career as a monk.  During that period, "though he was but a learner, no thoughts of evil arose in him," the implication being that his close connection with the Buddha and his devotion to him gave no room for such.  He, nevertheless, laments that he could not become an asekha while the Buddha was yet alive.  If this interpretation be accepted - and I see no reason why it should not be - there is no discrepancy in the accounts of Ānanda's ordination.[/p][hr][p][b]2. Ānanda.[/b]-A Khattiya king of Hamsavati, father of Padumuttara Buddha (J.i.37; Bu.xii.19).  He had, by another wife, a daughter Nandā, who became the therī Pakulā in the present age (ThigA.91).  Once, with twenty of his ministers and twenty thousand of his subjects, he appeared before Padumuttara Buddha at Mithilā and, having received the "ehi-bhikkhu-pabbajjā," they became arahants (MA.ii.722; DA.ii.488).  The Buddha went back with them to Hamsavatī where he preached the Buddhavamsa (BuA.160).[/p][p]One of Ānanda's sons was the prince Sumana, step-brother to Padumuttara, who became Ānanda, the personal attendant of Gotama Buddha.

According to the Majjhima Nikāya and its Commentary (M.iii.70; MA.ii.890), there were four Pacceka Buddhas of this name.[/p][hr][p][b]7. Ānanda.[/b]-A king of vultures.  He dwelt with ten thousand vultures in Gijjhakūta and came to hear Kunāla preach.  At the end of Kunāla's sermon Ānanda, too, discoursed in the same strain, dwelling on the evil qualities of women "keeping to facts within his knowledge" (J.v.424, 447-50).  He lived in the Kunāladaha with Nārada, Devala, Punnamukha, the cuckoo, and Kunāla (SnA.i.359).  In the present age the vulture-king was Ānanda Thera, the Buddha's attendant (J.v.456).[/p][hr][p][b]8. Ānanda.[/b]-A king of fishes, appointed by the fishes themselves to rule over them (J.i.207; ii.352).  He was one of the six monsters of the deep.  He lived on one side of the ocean and all the fishes came to him morning and evening to pay their respects.  He lived on rock-slime (sevāla) till one day he swallowed, by mistake, a fish.  Liking the taste very much, be found out what it was, and from that day he ate fish, unknown to his subjects.  Seeing their numbers diminish, they began to grow inquisitive, and one day one of their wise ones hid in the lobe of Ānanda's ear and discovered him eating the fish which straggled behind.  When this was reported to the other fish, they fled in terror and hid themselves.  Ānanda, desirous of eating them, searched everywhere; believing that they lay inside a mountain, he encircled it with his body.  Seeing his own tail on the other side of the mountain and believing it to be a fish trying to escape, he crunched it in a rage.  The tail was fifty leagues long and he suffered excruciating pain.  Attracted by the smell of blood, the fish collected round and ate him bit by bit.  His skeleton was as big as a mountain, and holy ascetics, flying through the air and seeing it below them, told men about it and the story became famous throughout Jambudīpa.  Kālahatthi is reported as relating this story to the king in the Mahā Sutasoma Jātaka (J.v.462-4).  Ānanda is referred to as an example of great deceitfulness.  MA.i.138.[/p][hr][p][b]9. Ānanda.[/b] A yakkha to whom a shrine, called the Ānanda Cetiya, was dedicated.  The Cetiya was in Bhoganagara and was later converted into a Buddhist Vihāra (AA.ii.550).  There the Buddha stayed during his last sojourn, and mention is made of a sermon he preached there to the monks on the Four Great Authorities (cattāro mahāpadesā) (D.ii.123-6; A.ii.167).  From there he went to Pāvā.[/p][hr][p][b]10. Ānanda[/b].-A banker of Sāvatthi.  He had eighty crores of money, but was a great miser.  He had a son, Mūlasiri, and once a fortnight he would gather his kinsfolk together and, in their presence, admonish his son as to the desirability of amassing wealth, always increasing it, giving none away.  When the banker died he was born in a Candāla family outside the city gates.  The king appointed Mūlasiri banker in his place.  [/p][p]From the time of Ānanda's conception among the Candālas, misfortune dogged their footsteps.  Knowing that a Jonah had come among them, they caused a search to be made and, as a result of their investigations, they sent the pregnant mother away.  When the child was born he was a monstrosity with his organs all out of place.  When old enough, he was given a potsherd and told to beg his living.  One day he came to the house in which he had lived in his former life, and though he managed to enter it, he was discovered and thrown out by the servants.  The Buddha happened to be passing by, and sending for Mūlasiri, he told him that the beggar had been his father.  Being convinced by certain proofs, Mūlasiri believed and took refuge in the Buddha (DhA.ii.25-8; the story is referred to in the Milindapañha p.350).  It is said that eighty-four thousand beings attained deathlessness on the occasion of the Buddha preaching to Mūlasiri about his father Ānanda.  AA.i.57.[/p][hr][p][b] [a name="11"]11[/a].

In spite of her protestations and admonitions, he overcame her resistance by force and, having worked his will of her, went away.  As if unable to endure his wickedness, the earth burst asunder and he was swallowed up in Avīci (DhA.ii.49-50).[/p][p]In order that such assaults should not be repeated, Pasenadi Kosala erected, at the Buddha's suggestion, a residence for the nuns within the city gates, and henceforth they lived only within the precincts of the city (DhA.ii.51f).[/p]</e>

Later, when his former companion came to the city, the householder visited him with his wife and child.  When they made obeisance to him, the ascetic said, "Long life to you" to the man and his wife, but not to the child.  When questioned, the ascetic told them that their son had but seven days to live, and suggested that they should visit the Buddha and ask him if there were any means of averting the child's fate.  [/p][p]They did so and the Buddha, who was then staying at the Āraññakutikā in Dīghalambika, told them to erect a pavilion outside the door of their house.  This they did, and in the pavilion the monks recited the Paritta continuously for seven days with the child seated before them on a bench.  On the seventh day the Buddha himself came and hosts of devas gathered round him.  The yakkha Avaruddhaka, who had been granted the boon of eating Dīghāyu, appeared to claim him at the time appointed for his death, but on account of the presence of the devas, he could not come near the boy.  The Buddha recited the Paritta all night long, and when the seventh day had passed Avaruddhaka could no longer claim the child.  The Buddha declared that the boy would live for one hundred and twenty years and he was renamed Āyuvaddhana.  When he grew up he became the leader of five hundred lay disciples.

Once when Nārada was on his way to Kañcanaguhā where he dwelt and which stood at the head of Manosilātala, he carried in his hand a Pāricchattaka flower, and the four daughters of Sakka - Āsā, Saddhā, Siri and Hirī - who were in Manosilātala, resting from their sports in Anotatta, on seeing him, asked him for the flower.  He said he would give it to the one among them whom they chose to be their queen.  He himself was asked to choose the queen, but he referred them to Sakka who, in his turn, sent them to the ascetic Macchariya-Kosiya in the Himālaya.  Sakka sent in advance a cup of ambrosia to the ascetic and told his daughters that the one among them, with whom Kosiya should share his ambrosia, would be deemed the best.  When they appeared before Kosiya he asked their names, and chose Hirī for the honour of sharing his meal.  In rejecting Āsā, Kosiya said, "They tell me that whoever pleases you, to him, by accomplishing the fruition of hope, you grant life, whosoever pleases you not, to him you grant it not.  In this case success does not come to him through you, but you bring about his destruction." He spoke in like terms to the other two.  The story occurs in the Sudhābhojana Jātaka.  J.v.392ff.[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Ānāpānasati Sutta[/div][p]Preached at Sāvatthi on Komudī, the full-moon day of the fourth month.  The monks had gathered together to see the Buddha and eminent disciples had been busy instructing their pupils in the various attainments.  The Commentary says the Buddha had not gone on tour as usual because he wanted to give the monks opportunity of developing their attainments.  (MA.ii.895-6.) [/p][p][/p][p]Seeing them thus assembled, the Buddha was pleased with their demeanour and described how in the confraternity of monks were to be found men of various degrees of attainment.  Some of them practised the cultivation of mindfulness by breathing exercises and the Buddha proceeded to explain how it was done.  Such mindfulness leads to the development of the four satipatthānas, and these, in turn, to the seven bojjhangas.  Through them one attains deliverance through understanding.  M.iii.78-88.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Ākāsānañcāyatanūpagā-devi[/div][p]A class of devas born in the Realm of Infinite Space (ākāsānañcāyatana) (M.iii.103).

  <e>[div class="huge"]Ālāra Kālāma[/div][p]One of the two teachers to whom Gotama, after his renunciation, first attached himself, the other being Uddaka Rāmaputta.  In the Milindapañha (p.236) Ālāra is mentioned as Gotama's fourth teacher.  The ThigA.  (p.2) says he went to Bhaggava before going to Ālāra.  The Mtu.  (ii.117f.) and the Lal.  (330f), give quite different accounts.[/p][p][/p][p]In the Ariyaparivesāna Sutta (M.i.163-5; also 240ff; ii.94ff, 212ff) the Buddha describes his visit to Ālāra.  Gotama quickly mastered his doctrine and was able to repeat it by heart; but feeling sure that Ālāra not only knew the doctrine but had realised it, he approached him and questioned him about it.  Ālāra then proclaimed the Ākiñcaññāyatana, and Gotama, putting forth energy and concentration greater than Ālāra's, made himself master of that state.  Ālāra recognised his pupil's eminence and treated him as an equal, but Gotama, not having succeeded in his quest, took leave of Ālāra to go elsewhere (VibhA.432).  When, after having practised austerities for six years, the Buddha attained Enlightenment and granted Sahampati's request to preach the doctrine, it was of Ālāra he thought first as being the fittest to hear the teaching.  But Ālāra had died seven days earlier (Vin.i.7).[/p][p][/p][p]The books mention little else about Ālāra.  The Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta (D.ii.130; Vsm.330) mentions a Mallian, Pukkusa, who says he had been Ālāra's disciple, but who, when he hears the Buddha's sermon, confesses faith in the Buddha.  Pukkusa describes Ālāra to the Buddha as one who practised great concentration.  Once Ālāra was sitting in the open air and neither saw nor heard five hundred passing carts though he was awake and conscious.[/p][p][/p][p]As already stated above, the aim of Ālāra's practices is stated to have been the attainment of Akiñcaññayatana, the stage of nothingness.  Whether this statement is handed down with any real knowledge of the facts of his teaching, it is not now possible to say.  Asvaghosa, in his Buddhacarita (xii.17ff), puts into the mouth of Ārāda or Ālāra, a brief account of his philosophy.  It has some resemblance - though this is slight - to the Sānkhya philosophy, but in Ālāra's teaching some of the salient characteristics of the Sānkhya system are absent.  In reply to Gotama's questions about the religious life and the obtaining of final release, Ālāra describes a system of spiritual development which is identical with the methods of the Buddhist monk up to the last attainment but one.  The monk reaches the four jhānas and then attains successively to the states of space, infinity and nothingness.  The last three stages are described in the terms of the first three of the four Attainments.  (For a discussion on this see Thomas, op.  cit., p.229-30; see also MA.ii.881; VibhA.432).  According to Buddhaghosa (AA.i.458), Bharandu Kālāma was a disciple of Ālāra at the same time as Gotama and is therefore described as the Buddha's purāna-sabrahmacārī (A.i.277).  Buddhaghosa further tells us (DA.ii.569) that in Ālāra Kālāma, Ālāra was his personal name.  He was so called because he was dīgha-pingala (long and tawny).[/p]</e>

They had their meals together and she waited on him, fetching him water and fanning him.

Vin.iv.263.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Āmagandha[/div][p]A brahmin.  Before the appearance of the Buddha in the world, Āmagandha became an ascetic and lived in the region of the Himālaya with five hundred pupils.  They ate neither fish nor flesh.  Every year they came down from their hermitage in search of salt and vinegar, and the inhabitants of a village near by received them with great honour and showed them every hospitality for four months.[/p][p]Then one day the Buddha, with his monks, visited the same village, and the people having listened to his preaching became his followers.  That year when Āmagandha and his disciples went as usual to the village, the householders did not show towards them the same enthusiasm as heretofore.  The brahmin, enquiring what had happened, was full of excitement on hearing that the Buddha had been born, and wished to know if he ate "āmagandha," by which he meant fish or flesh.  He was greatly disappointed on learning that the Buddha did not forbid the eating of āmagandha, but, desiring to hear about it from the Buddha himself, he sought him at Jetavana.  The Buddha told him that āmagandha was not really fish or flesh, but that it referred to evil actions, and that he who wished to avoid it should abstain from evil deeds of every kind.  The same question had been put to the Buddha Kassapa by an ascetic named Tissa, who later became his chief disciple.  In giving an account of the conversation between Kassapa Buddha and Tissa, the Buddha preached to Āmagandha the Āmagandha Sutta.  The Brahmin and his followers entered the Order and in a few days became arahants.  Sn., pp.42-5; SnA.i.278ff.[/p][hr][p][b]Āmagandha Sutta.[/b]-The conversation between the Buddha and the brabmin Āmagandha mentioned above (Sn.42ff).  According to Buddhaghosa (SnA.i.280ff) this was merely a reproduction of the conversation of the Buddha Kassapa with the ascetic Tissa, who later became his chief disciple.[/p][p]The sutta is particularly interesting as being one of the few passages in which sayings of the previous Buddhas are recorded.  The Buddha's view is put forward as being identical with that which had been enunciated long ago, with the intended implication that it was a self-evident proposition accepted by all the wise.[/p]</e>

The Buddha tells him that they should not depend on Anuruddha for interference in disputes, for he was by temperament unfitted for such action.

Ilanāga was his nephew.[/p][p]Āmandagāmani heightened the cone of the Mahā Thūpa and made additions to the Lohapāsāda and the Thūpārāma.  He also built the Rajatalena Vihāra and the Mahāgāmendi tank to the south of Anurādhapura, which latter he gave for the use of the Dakkhinavihāra.  [/p][p][/p][p]He enacted an order that there should be no slaughter of animals in Ceylon and had gourds planted everywhere.  To the whole brotherhood of monks in the island he once gave robes and alms-bowls filled with kumbhandaka fruits (pumpkins) and thereafter he was known by the name of Āmandagāmanī (Āmanda is evidently a synonym of Kumbhandaka).[/p][p][/p][p]His brother Kanirajānu-Tissa, having killed him, succeeded to the throne (Mhv.xxxv.1-10; MT.640).

  <e>[div class="huge"]Ālavakā (v.l.  Ālavikā)[/div][p]A name given to the monks of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aalavii,Ālavī')"]Ālavī[/a].  [/p][p]Buddhaghosa (Sp.iii.561) says that all children born in Ālavī were called Ālavakā.  The Ālavakā-bhikkhū are mentioned several times in the Vinaya (ii.172ff.; iii.85; iv.34-5) in connection with offences relating to navakamma (repairing and reconstruction of buildings), and rules are laid down by the Buddha restricting these monks in their activities.  Once when one of the monks was cutting down a tree which was the abode of a devata, the sprite was sorely tempted to kill him, but restraining her wrath she sought the Buddha and complained to him.  The Buddha praised her forbearance and preached the Uraga Sutta (SnA.i.4-5).[/p][p]In the introductory story of the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/manikhanta_jat_253,Manikantha Jātaka')"]Manikantha Jātaka[/a] (J.ii.282-3) it is stated that the importunities of these monks so annoyed the residents of Ālavī that they fled at the approach of any yellow-robed monk.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Ālavī[/div][p]A town thirty yojanas from Sāvatthi (SnA.i.220) and probably twelve from  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"]Benares[/a] (See Watters: ii.61; Fa Hsein, 60, 62).  It lay between Sāvatthi and Rājagaha.  (The Buddha goes from Sāvatthi to Kitāgiri, thence to Ālavī, and finally, to Rājagaha).  The Buddha, on several occasions, stayed at Ālavī at the Aggālava shrine (q.v.) which was near the town.  In the sixteenth year after the Enlightenment, the Buddha spent the whole of the rainy season at Ālavī and preached the doctrine to 84,000 listeners (BuA.3).  The King of Ālavī was known as Ālavaka and the inhabitants as Ālavaka.  The town later became famous as the residence of Ālavaka Yakkha and of Hatthaka Ālavaka.  The Therī, Selā was born in Ālavī and was therefore known as Alavikā (ThigA.62-3).  There was evidently a large community of monks at Ālavī, some of whom seem to have chiefly occupied themselves with building vihāras for themselves (See Ālavakā).[/p][p]Once, while at Sāvatthi, the Buddha saw a poor farmer of Ālavī, ready for conversion and decided to go and preach in that town.  The farmer's ox had strayed away, and he looked for it for quite a long while before finding it; he knew that the Buddha was in Ālavī and decided that he still had time to visit the Buddha, and he set off without taking any food.  Meanwhile at Ālavī the Buddha and his monks had been served with a meal by the people, but the Buddha waited until the farmer came before returning thanks.  On the farmer's arrival the Buddha ordered that some food should be given him, and when the man was comforted and his mind was ready the Buddha preached a sermon, at the end of which the man became a Sotāpanna (DhA.iii.262-3).[/p][p]On another occasion the Buddha came all the way from Jetavana to Ālavī for the sake of a weaver's daughter.  (For the story see DhA.iii.170f).[/p][p]Ālavī has been identified by Cunningham and Hoernle with Newal or Nawal in the Urao district in the United Provinces, and by Nandalal Dey, with Aviwa, twenty-seven miles north-east of Etwah (Law: Geog, of.  Early Buddhism, p.24).[/p][p]Mrs.  Rhys Davids states that Ālavī was on the bank of the Ganges (Ps.  of the Brethren, 408), probably basing her view on the declaration of Ālavaka in the Sutta Nipāta (p.32) that he would throw the Buddha "pāra-Gangāya" (over to the other side of the Ganges) unless his questions were answered.  I believe that here "pāra-Gangāya" is merely a rhetorical expression and has no geographical significance.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Ābhā Sutta[/div][p]There are four radiances: [/p][ul][li]that of the moon, [/li][li]the sun, [/li][li]of fire, and [/li][li]of wisdom, [/li][/ul][p]the last being the chief.  A.ii.139.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Ānañjasappāya Sutta[/div][p]Preached to the monks, with Ānanda at their head, by the Buddha at Kammassadhamma in the Kuru country.  It deals with real Permanence (ānañjasappāya) and with the various ways of meditating on impassibility and the attainments and true release.  True deathlessness is only the heart's deliverance (anupādā cittassa vimokkho), and there are several stages of the paths that lead to it (M.ii.261ff).  Buddhaghosa (MA.ii.851) says that this sutta described the arahantship of the Sukkhavipassakā.  Arahantship is mentioned in nine different connections in the sutta, which is therefore praised as being well taught (sukathitam).[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Āpana[/div][p]A city in the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anguttaraapa,Anguttarāpa')"]Anguttarāpa[/a] country (probably its capital).  The Buddha once visited the city with 1,250 monks and the whole company was entertained by the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/keniya,Jatila Keniya')"]Jatila Keniya[/a] (Vin.i.245ff).  From Āpana the Buddha went on to Kusinārā (Vin.i.247).  In the Samyutta Nikāya (S.v.225), Āpana is spoken of as a township of the Angas (Angānam nigamo) and the Buddha is mentioned as having stayed there with Sāriputta.  [/p][p]Several suttas were preached at Āpana, among them [/p][ul][li][p]the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/potaliya,Potaliya Sutta')"]Potaliya Sutta[/a] (regarding Potaliya), (M.i.359ff) [/li][li][p]the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/latukikopama_s,Latukikopama Sutta')"]Latukikopama Sutta[/a] (to Udāyi) (M.i.447ff), [/li][li][p]the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/s6_siy,Sela Sutta')"]Sela Sutta[/a] (regarding Sela) (M.ii.146ff; Sn.pp.102ff) and [/li][li][p]the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sadhaa,Saddha or Āpana Sutta')"]Saddha or Āpana Sutta[/a] (S.v.225-7).  [/li][/ul][p]Āpana was a brahmin village and was the home of the Elder Sela (ThagA.ii.47).  On the occasion of the Buddha's visit to Āpana, during which he converted Sela and Keniya, he seems to have stayed at Āpana for over a week and ordained three hundred monks in the company of Sela (Sn., p.112).[/p][p]According to Buddhaghosa (MA.ii.586), the village was called Āpana because it had twenty thousand bazaars (āpanā) and was therefore distinguished for its shops (āpanānam ussannattā).  Near the village, on the banks of the river Mahī, was the woodland where the Buddha stayed during his visits.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Āyācitabhatta Jātaka (No.  19)[/div][p]Once the squire of a certain village, in the Kāsi country, promised the deity of a banyan tree a sacrifice should his enterprise succeed.  When he came back from his journey he slew a number of creatures and took them to the tree.  The deity of the tree appeared and admonished the squire, saying that [b]no one could attain deliverance by means of slaughter[/b].[/p][p][/p][p]The story was related in answer to a question by some monks, who had noticed that many people when going on a business journey would slay living creatures and offer them to various deities in order that their ventures might be successful.  The monks wished to know if such sacrifices were of any good (J.i.169).[/p][p][/p][p]The Jātaka is also known as the Pānavadha Jātaka (Feer: JA.1876, p.516).[/p]</e>
