This was because his mother was a lioness.  For a lioness, when she has eaten prey, goes into her cave where she lies, for seven days, on a bed of red arsenic and yellow orpiment.  When she rises on the seventh day, if she finds the bed disturbed by any movement on her part, she again lies down for seven days, saying: "This does not become your birth or lineage."

But many of the Sākyans spoke scornfully of him, saying that he had failed in the training and had taken to drink.  Mahānāma reported this to the Buddha, who said that Sarakāni had, for a long time, taken refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, and possessed qualities which secured him from birth in hell among the lowest animals and the peta world.  S.v.375f.[/p][hr][p][b]1. Sarakāni (Saranāni) Sutta.[/b] Mahānāma reports to the Buddha the rumours prevalent among the Sākyans regarding Sarakāni (q.v.).

S.v.375f.[/p][hr][p][b]2. Sarakāni Sutta.[/b] Mahānāma brings to the Buddha's notice that the Sākyans are surprised at the Buddha's statement regarding the attainment of sotāpatti by Sarakāni.  The Buddha then describes the virtues which make a man an anāgāmī, a sakadāgāmī or a sotāpanna.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Sāvatthi[/div][p]The capital town of Kosala in India and one of the six great Indian cities during the lifetime of the Buddha (D.ii.147).  It was six leagues from Sāketa (Vin.i.253; seven according to others, DhA.i.387), forty five leagues north west of Rājagaha (SA.i.243), thirty leagues from Sankassa (J.iv.265), one hundred and forty seven from Takkasilā (MA.ii.987), one hundred and twenty from Suppāraka (DhA.ii.213), and was on the banks of the Aciravatī (Vin.i.191, 293).  It was thirty leagues from Alavī (SNA.i.220), thirty from Macchīkāsanda (DhA.ii.79), one hundred and twenty from Kukkutavatī (DhA.ii.118), and the same distance from Uggapura (DhA.iii.469) and from Kuraraghara (DhA.iv.106).  The road from Rājagaha to Sāvatthi passed through Vesāli (Vin.ii.159f), and the Parāyanavagga (SN.vss.1011 13) gives the resting places between the two cities Setavyā, Kapilavatthu, Kusinārā, Pāvā and Bhoganagara.  Further on, there was a road running southwards from Sāvatthi through Sāketa to Kosambī.  One gāvuta from the city was the Andhavana (q.v.).  Between Sāketa and Sāvatthi was Toranavatthu (S.iv.374).[/p][p]The city was called Sāvatthi because the sage Savattha lived there.  Another tradition says there was a caravanserai there, and people meeting there asked each other what they had "Kim bhandam atthi?" "Sabbam atthi" and the name of the city was based on the reply (SNA.i.300; PSA.  367).[/p][p]The Buddha passed the greater part of his monastic life in Sāvatthi.  His first visit there was at the invitation of Anāthapindika.  It is said (DhA.i.4) that he spent twenty five rainy seasons in the city nineteen of them in Jetavana and six in the Pubbārāma.  Sāvatthi also contained the monastery of Rājakārāma (q.v.), built by Pasenadi, opposite Jetavana.  Outside the city gate of Sāvatthi was a fisherman's village of five hundred families (DhA.iv.40).[/p][p]Savatthi is the scene of each Buddha's Yamaka pātihāriya (DhA.iii.205; cf.  Mtu.iii.115; J.i.88); Gotama Buddha performed this miracle under the Gandamba (q.v.).[/p][p]The chief patrons of the Buddha in Sāvatthi were Anāthapindika, Visākhā, Suppavāsā and Pasenadi (DhA.i.330).  When Bandhula (q.v.) left Vesāli he came to live in Sāvatthi.[/p][p]Buddhaghosa says (Sp.iii.614) that, in the Buddha's day, there were fifty seven thousand families in Sāvatthi, and that it was the chief city in the country of Kāsi Kosala, which was three hundred leagues in extent and had eighty thousand villages.  The population of Sāvatthi was eighteen crores (SNA.i.371).[/p][p]Sāvatthi is identified with Sāhet Māhet on the banks of the Rapti (Cunningham, AGI.  469).[/p][p]Hiouen Thsang found the old city in ruins, but records the sites of various buildings (Beal, op.  cit., ii.1 13).[/p][p]Woodward states (KS.v.xviii ) that, of the four Nikāyas, 871 suttas are said to have been preached in Sāvatthi; 844 of which are in Jetavana, 23 in the Pubbārāma, and 4 in the suburbs.  These suttas are made up of 6 in the Digha, 75 in the Majjhima, 736 in the Samyutta, and 54 in the Anguttara.  Mrs.  Rhys Davids conjectures (M.iv., Introd., p.vi) from this that either the Buddha "mainly resided there or else Sāvatthi was the earliest emporium (library?) for the collection and preservation (however this was done) of the talks." The first alternative is the more likely, as the Commentaries state that the Buddha spent twenty five rainy seasons in Sāvatthi (see earlier), this leaving only twenty to be spent elsewhere.  The Buddhavamsa Commentary (BuA.  p.3) gives a list of these places showing that the second, third, fourth, seventeenth and twentieth were spent in Rājagaha, the thirteenth, eighteenth and nineteenth in Cāliyapabbata, and the rest in different places.[/p]</e>

They recognized each other at the Yakkha assembly in the Bhagalavatī pabbata, and promised to inform each other if, in their lives, they came across anything of interest.[/p][p]When the Buddha was born and when he preached his first sermon, Sātāgira was present in the assembly, but, because he was constantly looking about to see if Hemavata was there, he could not concentrate his mind on the Buddha's teaching.  When the sun set and the Buddha was still preaching, he went with five hundred of his followers to fetch Hemavata.  At Rājagaha they met Hemavata, who was on the way to invite Sātāgira to Himavā, which was covered with such flowers as had never before been seen.  Sātāgira explains that the reason for this miracle is the appearance of the Buddha in the world, and, in answer to Hemavata's questions, declares the greatness of the Buddha.  [/p][p]Their conversation is found in the introductory gāthā of the Hemavata Sutta (q.v.).  Buddhaghosa says (SNA.i.199) that, according to some, this meeting took place, not on the occasion of the first sermon, but later, when the Buddha was living in the Gotāmaka cetiya.

Hemavata is, by nature, powerful and wise and filled with respect for the good, and the Buddha's marvellous exposition of the dhamma fills him with great joy.  He sings the Buddha's praises in five stanzas, and, after taking leave of him and of Sātāgira, returns home with the promise that he will wander from place to place carrying the joyful news of the Buddha and his Dhamma among all beings.  This story is given in the Commentary to the Hemavata Sutta; SNA.i.194 216; cf.

When they thus discovered his presence, they alighted and made obeisance to the Buddha, and congratulated Alavaka on his extreme good fortune in having an opportunity of meeting and listening to the Buddha.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Sāgata [/div][hr][p][b]1. Sāgata Thera.  [/b] He was the personal attendant of the Buddha at he time when Sona Kolvisa visited Bimbisāra, with overseers of the eighty thousand townships of Bimbisāra's kingdom.  Sāgata was endowed with supernatural power, and the overseers, who went to visit the Buddha at Gijjhakūta, were very impressed by his iddhi, so much so that even while the Buddha was preaching they could not take their eyes off him.  The king thereupon asked Sāgata to show them a greater marvel, and Sāgata, having shown in the open sky wonders of various kinds, fell at the Buddha's feet and declared the Buddha his teacher (Vin.i.179 f).[/p][p]Later, when the Buddha went to stay in Bhaddavatikā, having heard men warn the Buddha of the proximity of a Nāga of great power in the Jatila hermitage at Ambatittha, Sāgata went there and lived in the Nāga's abode.  The Nāga showed great resentment, but Sāgata overpowered him with his iddhi and then returned to Bhaddavatikā.  From there he went with the Buddha to Kosambī, where the lay disciples, hearing of his wondrous feat, paid him great honour.  When they asked what they could do for his comfort, he remained silent, but the Chabbaggīyā suggested that they should provide him with white spirits (kāpotikā).[/p][p]The next day, when Sāgata went for alms, he was invited to various houses, where the inmates plied him with intoxicating drinks.  So deep were his potations that on his way out of the town he fell prostrate at the gateway.  The monks carried him, and at the monastery they laid him down with his head at the Buddha's feet, but he turned round so that his feet lay towards the Buddha.  The Buddha pointed out his condition to the monks, using it as an example of the evil effects of liquor; and he made this the occasion for the passing of a rule against the use of alcohol.  Vin.iv.108f.; the story: is also given as the introduction to the Surāpāna Jātaka (J.i.360 ff.) which, too, was preached on this occasion; cf.  AA.i.178f.[/p][p]It is said (AA.i.179) that on the next day, when Sāgata came to himself and realized the enormity of his offence, he sought the Buddha and, having begged his forgiveness, developed insight, attaining arahantship.  The Buddha later declared him foremost among those skilled in the contemplation of the heat element (tejodhātukusalānam) (A.i.25).[/p][p]It is curious that no verses are ascribed to Sāgata in the Theragāthā.  The Apadāna (Ap.i.83f) contains a set of verses said to have been spoken by him.  In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was Sobhita, a brahmin.  The Buddha came to his hermitage with his disciples, and Sāgata spoke verses in praise of the Buddha, who declared his future destiny.  The Commentary adds that he was called Sāgata because he was greatly welcome (sāgata) to his parents.[/p][hr][p][b]2. Sāgata.[/b] The personal attendant of Dīpankara Buddha.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Sāketa[/div][p]A town in Kosala.  It was regarded in the Buddha's time as one of the six great cities of India, the others being Campā, Rājagaha, Sāvatthi, Kosambī and Benares (D.ii.146).  It was probably the older capital of Kosala, and is mentioned as such in the Nandiyamiga Jātaka.  J.iii.270; cf.  Mtu.i.348, 349, 350, where it is called the capital of King Sujāta of the Sākyan race.  See also the Kumbha Jātaka (J.ii.13), where Sāketa is mentioned as one of the places into which alcohol was introduced quite soon after its discovery by Sura and Varuna.  According to the Mahānārada Kassapa Jātaka (J.vi.228), it was the birthplace of Bijaka, aeons ago.  In this context it is called Sāketā.  According to a tradition, recorded in the Mahāvastu, Sāketa was the city from which Sākyan princes were exiled when they founded Kapilavatthu.  E.  J.  Thomas accepts this view (op.  cit., 16f.).[/p][p]The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.386), however, states that the city was founded in the Buddha's time by Dhanañjaya, father of Visākhā, when, at the special invitation of Pasenadi, he went from Rājagaha to live in Kosala.  On the way to Sāvatthi with Pasenadi, Dhañanjaya pitched his camp for the night, and learning from the king that the site of the camp was in Kosalan territory and seven leagues from Sāvatthi, Dhanañjaya obtained the king's permission to found a city there.  And because the site was first inhabited in the evening (sāyam), the city came to be called Sāketa.  The Divyāvadāna (211) has another explanation of the name, in connection with the coronation of Mandhātā (Svayam āgatam svayam āgatam Sāketa Sāketam iti sañjnā samvrttā).[/p][p]The reference is probably to a new settlement established by Dhanañjaya in the old city.[/p][p]We also learn from the Visuddhimagga (p.390; but see below) that the distance from Sāketa to Sāvatthi was seven leagues (yojanas), and there we are told that when the Buddha, at the invitation of Cūla subhaddā, went from Sāvatthi to Sāketa, he resolved that the citizens of the two cities should be able to see each other.  In the older books (E.g., Vin.i.253) however, the distance is given as six leagues.  The town lay on the direct route between Sāvatthi and Patitthāna, and is mentioned (SN.vss.1011 1013) as the first stopping place out of Sāvatthi.  The distance between the two places could be covered in one day, with seven relays of horses (M.i.149), but the books contain several references (E.g., Vin.i.88, 89, 270; iii.212; iv.  63, 120) to the dangers of the journey when undertaken on foot.  The road was infested with robbers, and the king had to maintain soldiers to protect travellers.[/p][p]Midway between Sāketa and Sāvatthi was Toranavatthu, and it is said (S.iv.374 ff) that, when Pasenadi went from the capital to Sāketa, he spent a night in Toranavatthu, where be visited Khemā Therī who lived there.  Between Sāketa and Sāvatthi was a broad river which could be crossed only by boat (Vin.iv.65, 228).  Near Sāketa was the Añjanavana, where the Buddha sometimes stayed during his visits to Sāketa and where he had several discussions e.g., with Kakudha (S.i.54), Mendasira (q.v.), and Kundaliya (S.v.73; see also Kālaka Sutta and Jarā Sutta and Sāketa Sutta).[/p][p]On other occasions he stayed at the Kālakārāma (A.ii.24) gifted to the Order by Kālaka(q.v.), and the Tikantakivana (A.iii.169), both of which were evidently near the city.  Mention is also made (E.g., S.v.174, 298 f.; for Sāriputta, see also Vin.i.289) of Sāriputta, Moggallāna and[/p][p]Anuruddha staying together in Sāketa; Bhaddākāpilāni (Vin.iv.292) also stayed there, so did Ananda.  Once when Ananda was staying in the Migadāya in the Anjanavana, a nun, described as Jatilagāhikā (probably a follower of the Jatilas), visited him and questioned him regarding concentration.  A.iv.427. Among others who lived in Sāketa were Jambugāmikaputta, Gavampati, Mendasira, Uttara, Madhuvāsettha and his son Mahānāga, and Visākhā.  Bhūta Thera (q.v.) was born in a suburb of Sāketa.[/p][p]Buddhaghosa says (SNA.ii.532 f.; cf.  DhA.iii.317f.  and Saketa Jātaka) that there lived at Sāketa a brahmin and his wife who, in five hundred lives, had been the parents of the Buddha.  When the Buddha visited Sāketa they met him, and, owing to their fondness for him, came to be called Buddhapitā and Buddhamātā, their family being called Buddhakula.[/p][p]According to some accounts (E.g., AA.ii.482; but see Cūla-Subhaddā), Anāthapindika's daughter, Cūla-Subhaddā, was married to the son of Kālaka, a setthi of Sāketa.  Kālaka was a follower of the Niganthas, but he allowed Subhaddā to invite the Buddha to a meal.  She did this by scattering eight handfuls of jasmine-flowers into the air from her balcony.  The Buddha read her thoughts, and went to Sāketa the next day with five hundred arahants.  At Sakka's request, Vessavana (Vissakamma?) provided gabled chambers in which the Buddha and his monks travelled by air to Sāketa.  At the end of the meal, the Buddha preached to Kālakasetthi, who became a sotāpanna, and gave the Kālakārāma for the use of the monks.[/p][p]The Vinaya (Vin.i.270f) mentions another setthi of Sāketa.  His wife had suffered for seven years from a disease of the head, and even skilled physicians failed to cure her.  Jīvaka, on his way to Rājagaha, after finishing his studies in Takkasilā, visited Sāketa, heard of her illness, and offered to cure her.  At first the setthi was sceptic, but in the end allowed Jīvaka to attend on his wife.  Jīvaka cured her by the administration of ghee through the nose, and, as reward, received sixteen thousand kahāpanas from her and her various kinsmen.[/p][p]Sāketa, is supposed to be identical with Ayojjhā (CAGI.  405), but as both cities are mentioned in the Buddha's time, they are probably distinct.  Rhys Davids thinks that possibly they adjoined each other "like London and Westminster" (Bud.  India, p.  39. See also Sāketa Sutta, Sāketa Jātaka, Sāketapañha).  The site of Sāketa has been identified with the ruins of Sujān Kot, on the Sai River, in the Unao district of the modern province of Oudh.  The river referred to is probably the Sarayū, which flows into the Gharghara, a tributary of the Ganges.[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Nigantha Nātaputta (Nāthaputta)[/div][p]One of six eminent teachers, contemporary with the Buddha; he is described as a heretic (aññatitthiya, E.g., S.i.66).  [/p][p]He was leader of a sect known as the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/niganthaa,Niganthā')"]Niganthā[/a], and a summary of his teachings is found in the Sāmaññaphala Sutta (D.i.57; DA.i.166).  [/p][p]A Nigantha is restrained with a fourfold restraint (cātuyāma samvara) [/p][ul][li]he is restrained as regards all water, [/li][li]restrained as regards all evil, [/li][li]all evil has he washed away, and [/li][li]he lives suffused with the sense of evil held at bay.  [/li][/ul][p]And, because of this fourfold restraint, [/p][ul][li]he is called a Nigantha (free from bonds), [/li][li]gatatta (one whose heart has been in the attainment of his aim), [/li][li]yattala (one whose heart is under command) and [/li][li]thitatta (one whose heart is fixed).[/li][/ul][p]The meaning of this fourfold restraint is not clear; for a discussion of this cātuyāma samvara, see Barua: Pre-Buddhistic Indian Philosophy, pp.  378f.  The first in evidently the well known rule of the Jains against drinking cold water, as it contains "souls" (cp.  Mil.259ff).  The Buddha taught a corresponding fourfold restraint, which consisted of observing the four precepts against injury, stealing, unchastity and lying (D.iii.48f.) [/p][p]Nātaputta is also stated (*1) to have claimed omniscience - to be all-knowing, all seeing, to have all comprising (aparisesa) knowledge and vision.  "Whether I walk or stand or sleep or wake," he is mentioned as saying, "my knowledge and vision are always, and without a break, present before me."[/p][hr][blockquote][p](*1) E.g., M.ii.31; A.i.220; M.i.92f.;also M.ii.214ff.  It is curious, in view of this statement of Nātaputta's doctrine of inaction, that the main ground on which he is stated to have objected to Siha's visit to the Buddha, was that the Buddha was an akīriyavādī (A.iv.180).[/p][/blockquote][hr][p]He taught that past deeds should be extirpated by severe austerities, fresh deeds should be avoided by inaction.  By expelling through penance all past misdeeds and by not committing fresh misdeeds, the future became cleared.  From the destruction of deeds results the destruction of dukkha; this leads to the destruction of vedanā.  Thus all dukkha is exhausted and one passes beyond (the round of existence).  It is said* that Nātaputta did not employ the term kamma in his teaching; he used, instead, the word danda; and that, according to him, the danda of deed was far more criminal than the dandas of word and mind.  [/p][hr][blockquote][p]* M.i.371. Danda probably means sins or hurtful acts.  Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.595ff.) that the Jain idea was that citta (the manodanda) did not come into bodily acts or into words which were irresponsible and mechanical, like the stirring and sighing of boughs in the wind.[/p][/blockquote][hr][p]He is said to have shown no hesitation in declaring the destinies of his disciples after death (S.iv.398); but Sakuludāyi says (M.ii.31; also ibid., i.93; and ii.214f.; the Niganthas admit they did not know of the past) that when asked a question as to the past, he skipped from one matter to another and dismissed the question, evincing irritation, bad temper and resentment.[/p][p]Only one discussion is recorded between Nātaputta and a follower of the Buddha, and that was with Citta gahapati at Macchikā Sanda (S.iv.298ff).  He praises Citta at the outset of the discussion, holding him up as an example to his own flock, and agreeing with Citta that knowledge is more excellent than faith.  But later, when Citta claims knowledge of the four jhānas, Nātaputta is represented as condemning him for a deceitful man.  Citta, thereupon, asks him ten questions and, getting no answer, leaves him.  The Commentary (SA.iii.99) explains that the questions Citta asked were the same as the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kumaarapanha,Kumārapañhā')"]Kumārapañhā[/a].[/p][p]The Devadaha Sutta (M.ii.214; cp.  Cūlla Dukkhakkhandha Sutta; M.i.91ff.; also A.v.150; D.iii.119), contains a detailed analysis and attributed to the Buddha, of the beliefs and teachings of the Niganthas.  He there selects for his condemnation ten of their operative utterances, major and minor, and proves that the efforts and strivings of the Niganthas are fruitless.[/p][p]Nātaputta is said (DhA.iii.201) to have claimed miraculous powers, but he did not, in fact, possess them.  When, for instance, the Rājagaha-setthi offered his bowl of red sandal wood to anybody who could remove it from its perch, Nātaputta tried to obtain it by a ruse, but was unable to deceive the setthi.[/p][p]The books contain the names of several disciples of Nātaputta, among them a deva called Ninka (S.i.66; the Buddha's own paternal uncle, Vappa, was a follower of the Niganthas).  Nātaputta is so convinced of the truth and the irrefutableness of his own doctrines, that he actually encourages his disciples to hold discussions with the Buddha.  Some, like Dīgha Tapassī, come away unscathed, without having carried the discussion to any conclusion; others are mentioned as being convinced by the Buddha in the end and as becoming his disciples.  Such, for instance, are Asibandhakaputta (S.iv.317ff) and Abhayarājakumāra (M.i.392ff).  Nātaputta tries, without success, to dissuade Sīha, general of the Licchavis, from visiting the Buddha (A.iv.180ff).  Sīha goes and is converted.  The next day he holds an almsgiving, on a grand scale, to the Buddha and his monks, at which flesh is served.  It is said that Nātaputta went about Vesāli, sneering at the Buddha for encouraging slaughter.  The Buddha, hearing of this, relates the Telovāda Jātaka (J.ii.262f.; Vin.i.233ff), to show that in the past, too, Nātaputta had sneered at him for a similar reason.  Nātaputta is identified with the rich man of the Jātaka.  In the Bāveru Jātaka (J.iii.126f) he is identified with the crow who lost all his honour and glory when approached by the peacock, who was the Bodhisatta.[/p][p]But the greatest blow to Nātaputta was when Upāli-gahapati (M.i.373ff) joined the Buddha.  Nātaputta had allowed Upāli to visit him in spite of the warning of Dīgha-Tapassī as to the Buddha's arresting personality.  But Nātaputta thought Upāli would be proof against it, and, on hearing that he had renounced his allegiance to the Niganthas, refused to believe it until he could verify the information himself.  The discovery of the apostasy of Upāli prostrated him with grief; he vomited hot blood and had to be carried away on a litter from Bālaka, where he was then living, to Pāvā.  There, soon after, he died, and immediately great dissensions arose among his followers.  When the Buddha heard of the quarrels, he remarked that it was only to be expected.[/p][p](Ibid., ii.243f.; D.iii.117, 210; it is stated that the quarrel was deliberately fostered by Nātaputta before his death.  See Niganthā).[/p][p]Nigantha Nātaputta is the name by which the Jaina teacher, Mahāvīra, was known to his contemporaries.  He was also called Vardhamāna.  Nāta (or Nāya) was the name of his clan (SNA.  (ii.423) says Nāta was the name of his father), which belonged to Vesāli.  According to Jaina tradition, his father's personal name was Siddhatha, and he was a Ksatriya, his mother being Trisālā.

Making this his topic of thought, he developed insight into the perishable ness of life and became an arahant (Thag.vs.267 70; ThagA.i.378).  Another day (evidently earlier than the previous incident), while walking with the Buddha, they came to a cleft in the road, and the Buddha wished to go along one way, while Nāgasamāla wished to go along another, in spite of the Buddha's warning that it was dangerous.  In the end, he put the Buddha's begging bowl and robe on the ground and left him.  Brigands waylaid him and ill treated him, breaking his bowl and threatening to kill him.  Thereupon he turned back to the Buddha and asked his forgiveness (Ud.viii.7; UdA.425f).[/p][p]Nāgasamāla was a householder in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, and, seeing the Buddha walking in the sun, he gave him an umbrella.

[/p][p]It is significant that the Culla Niddesa contains no comments on the fifty six (Vatthugāthā) introductory stanzas, which preface the Parāyana Vagga as at present found in the Sutta Nipāta.  This lends support to the suggestion that at the time the Culla Niddesa was written the Parāyana Vagga, was a separate anthology, and that the Khaggavisāna Sutta did not belong to any particular group.  Similarly with the Mahā Niddesa and the Atthaka Vagga.[/p][p]The comments in the Niddesa seem to have been modeled on exegetical explanations such as are attributed here and there in the Pitakas to Mahā Kaccāna (E.g., Madhupindika Sutta (M.i.110f); also S.iii.9) and to Sāriputta (E.g., Sangitī Sutta, D.iii.207f).[/p][p]There is a tradition (NidA.  p.1), which ascribes the authorship of the Niddesa to Sāriputta.

When quite young, he was given to a Brahmin, who fed him on delicacies and looked after him.  When Nandi grew up, in order to show his gratitude to the Brahmin, he suggested that he should draw one hundred carts for a wager.  The Brahmin boasted to his friends and had a wager with them.  On the appointed day he loaded one hundred carts, lashed them together, and having tied Nandivisala to the first, took his seat on the pole and, flourishing his goad, shouted, "Now, you rascal, pull." The bull, very offended, would not stir, and the Brahmin lost his money.  As he lay groaning in bed, Nandivisala went to him and said that he should not have abused him.  He then asked him to wager two thousand, and said that this time he would win.  This the Brahmin did, and the next day, having tied one hundred carts together, he yoked Nandivisala to the frat and stroked his back saying, "Now then, my fine fellow, pull." With one heave, Nandivisala pulled the carts, and the last stood where the first had been.  Nandivisala's master received many presents in addition to the wager.[/p][p]The story was related in reference to the taunts uttered by the Chabbaggiyas against the virtuous monks.[/p][p]Ananda was the brahmin of the story (J.i.191ff.; the story is also given at Vin.iv.5).

Nalakapāna Sutta[/h4][p]Preached at the Palāsavana in Nalakapāna.  The Buddha asks the assembled monks among whom are many distinguished members, such as Anuruddha, Kimbīla, Nandiya and others - if they feel they have realized the aim for which they have given up household life? On their assenting, he proceeds to tell them that when he claims that he has destroyed the āsavas and that his disciples have gained various attainments through his teaching, he does so, not in order to cajole or to delude others, nor to gain fame and profit for himself, but to hearten and fill with enthusiasm believing young men, that they may concentrate with their whole hearts and follow the example of his disciples.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Nigrodhārāma[/div][hr][h4]1. Nigrodhārāma[/h4][p]A grove near Kapilavatthu, where a residence was provided for the Buddha when he visited the city in the first year after his Enlightenment (MA.i.289).  It belonged to a Sākyan named Nigrodha, who gave it to the Order.  In order to convince his proud kinsmen of his attainments, the Buddha performed there the Yamakapātihāriya, and when, at the conclusion of the miracle' a shower of rain fell, wetting only those who wished to be wetted, he related to them the Vessantara Jātaka (Vin.i.82; J.i.88f.;vi.479; BuA.22; DhA.iii.163; also Mtu.iii.101, 107, 114,138,141, 179).  It wa's during this visit that Mahāpajāpati Gotamī first asked permission for women to enter the Order.  This was refused, and from there the Buddha went on to Vesāli (Vin.ii.253; A.iv.274).  The Buddha stayed at the Nigrodhārāma on several other occasions, and several Vinaya rules are mentioned as being first promulgated there (E.g., Vin.iii.235, 244; iv.55, 101, 167, 181, 262, 314).  Various Sākyans came to see the Buddha at the Nigrodh,ārāma, among them, Mahānāma, Godha, Sarakāni, Nandiya and Vappa (S.v.369 78; 395 7, 403 4, 408; A.ii.196; iii.284; iv.220; v.  83, 328, 332, 334).  The Buddha himself visited Kāligodhā during his residence there.  It was during a discussion with Mahānāma that the Cula Dukkhakkhandha Sutta (q.v.) was preached.  During one of the Buddha's residences in Nigrodhārāma, the Sākyans invited him to consecrate their new Mote Hall, which he did by preaching there far into the night and then asking Moggallāna to continue his discourse (S.iv.182ff.; also M.i.353, Sekha Sutta).  On another occasion the Buddha is mentioned as having spent a period of convalescence at Nigrodhārāma (A.i.219f ); he was there also when the quarrel broke out between the Sākyans and the Koliyans regarding the water of the Rohinī (SNA.i.357; but see J.v.413, where he is said to have been in Sāvatthi).  It seems to have been the Buddha's custom, when staying at Nigrodhārāma, sometimes to spend the noonday siesta in the Mahāvana near by (E.g., S.iii.91f).[/p][p]Among others mentioned as having stayed at Nigrodhārāma are Anuruddha (DhA.iii.295) and Lomasakangiya.  M.iii.200; a deva called Candana there taught him the Bhaddekaratta, Sutta.  Is this Lomasakangīya the same as Lomavangīsa, who is also mentioned (S.v.327) as having lived in Nigrodhārāma?[/p][p][/p][p]Near Nigrodhārāma was once the site of the dwelling of a hermit (isi) called Kanha.  The Buddha, remembering this, once smiled, and, when asked the reason for his smile, related the Kanha Jātaka (J.iv.6).[/p][p]There is a tradition (CypA.1,7; BuA.3) that the Cariyā Pitaka and the Buddhavamsa were preached by the Buddha to Sāriputta during his first stay in Nigrodhārāma.  It was probably there that Anuruddha's sister built, at his request, an assembly hall of two storeys for the Sangha (DhA.iii.295f).  Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.906; M.iii.109f ) that Kāla Khemaka, the Sākyan, built a special vihāra near Nigrodhārāma, on one side of the grounds.[/p][hr][h4]2. Nigrodhārāma[/h4][p]A grove in Rājagaha.

The old man died and, at his mother's suggestion, the son asked Nanda to show him where the wealth was buried.  Nanda took him to the place in the forest, but as soon as he started digging, the thought of being able to get the money for himself so elated him that he started abusing his master.  The young man pretended not to hear, and said they would go some other time.  Several times the same thing happened, and at last the son decided to consult his father's friend, the Bodhisatta.  The latter told him to note where Nanda started digging, and then to dig there himself and so get the treasure.

Just as, when a man, faring through a forest, comes upon an ancient city and announces his discovery to the king, who has the city restored, so did the Buddha see the ancient path traversed by the Enlightened Ones of the past and declare it to many, to devas and to men.

The Buddha condemned the Niganthas as unworthy in ten respects: [/p][ol][li]they were without faith, [/li][li]unrighteous, [/li][li]without fear and shame, [/li][li]they chose wicked men as friends, [/li][li]extolled themselves and disparaged others, [/li][li]were greedy of present gain, [/li][li]obstinate, [/li][li]untrustworthy, [/li][li]sinful in their thoughts, [/li][li]and held wrong views (A.v.150).  [/li][/ol][p]Their fast resembled a herdsman looking after the kine by day, which were restored to their owners at eventide (Ibid., i.205f).  The Niganthas were so called because they claimed to be free from all bonds (amhākam ganthanakileso palibujjhanakileso natthi, kilesaganthirahitā mayan ti evam vāditāya laddhanāmavasena Nigantho) (E.g., MA.i.423).  [/p][p]The Buddhist books record (M.ii.243f.; D.iii.117, 210) that there was great dissension among the Niganthas after the death of Nātaputta at Pāvā.  The Commentaries state (DA.iii.906; MA.ii.831) that Nātaputta, realizing on his death bed the folly and futility of his teaching, wished his followers to accept the Buddha's teaching In order to bring this about, he taught his doctrine in two different ways to two different pupils, just before his death.  To the one he said that his teaching was Nihilism (uccheda), and to the other that it was Eternalism (sassata).  As a result, they quarrelled violently among themselves, and the Order broke up.  [/p][p]That the Niganthas lasted till, at least, the time of Nāgasena, is admitted (Mil.p.4) by the fact that Milinda, was asked to consult a teacher called Nigantha Nātaputta, who, if at all historical, was probably the direct successor to the teacher of the same name, contemporary with the Buddha.  [/p][p]There is evidence in the Jātakas to show that the Nigantha Order was in existence prior to the life of the Buddha.  Saccatapāvī, mentioned in the Kunāla Jātaka (J.v.427), is described as a setasamanī, and may well have belonged to the Order of the Svetambaras, while in the Mahābodhi Jātaka (J.v.246) mention is made of a teacher who is identified with Nigantha Nātaputta himself.[/p][p]There seems to have been a settlement of Niganthas in Ceylon from very early times.  When Pandukābhaya laid out the city of Anurādhapura, he built also hermitages for several Niganthas - Jotiya, Giri and Kumbhanda (Mhv.x.97f).  These continued to be inhabited even after the establishment of Buddhism in the Island, for we hear of them in the reign of Vattagāmanī (circa 44 A.C.).  When Vattagāmanī pulled down the residence of the Nigantha Giri, because of his disloyalty to the king, he built on its site the Abhayagiri vihāra.  (Ibid., xxxiii.42f.)[/p]</e>

With him was the leader of another herd, and he was called Sākha.  There was an agreement between these two leaders that, on alternate days, a deer from their herd should offer itself to be killed by the king of Benares.  One day the turn fell on a pregnant doe of Sākha's herd, and when she asked to be allowed to wait until she had brought forth her young she was refused by Sākha.  She then appealed to Nigrodha, who took her turn on himself.  Immunity had been granted to Nigrodha, and when his act was reported to the king, he came in person to enquire into the matter.  On hearing the story, he was greatly moved, and promised immunity both to Nigrodha and the doe.  But Nigrodha was not satisfied till the king promised immunity to all living beings.  Later, on discovering that the deer, taking advantage of this, were destroying men's crops, Nigrodha, gave orders to his herd to refrain from doing so.[/p][p]The story was related in reference to the mother of Kumāra Kassapa (q.v.).  She had joined the Order under Devadatta not knowing that she was pregnant.  On discovering her condition, Devadatta expelled her from the Order.

The king of Kosala was very fond of hunting, and his subjects, that they might be left in peace, planned to drive deer from the forest into a closed park where the king might hunt.  Nandiya, seeing the men come, left his parents in the thicket and joined the deer who were being driven into the park so that his parents might not be seen.  The deer agreed each to take his turn in being killed by the king.  The Bodhisatta stayed on even in spite of a message brought by a Brahmin from his parents though he could have escaped.  But he wished to show his gratitude to the king who had supplied the deer with food and drink.  When his turn came to be killed, he appeared fearlessly before the king, and by the power of his virtue the king's bow refused to shoot.  The king thereupon realized Nandiya's goodness and granted him a boon.  Nandiya asked for security for all living beings, and established the king in the path of virtue.[/p][p]The story was related in reference to a monk who was blamed for looking after his parents.

(The Apadāna (ii.499) says he belonged to a rich clan of merchants and that he entered the Order at the ceremony of dedication of Jetavana.)[/p][p]Having entered the Order after hearing a sermon of the Buddha, he developed insight and soon attained arahantship.  Once, at the Buddha's request, he preached a sermon to the nuns; on the first day they became sotāpannas, and, on the second, five hundred of them attained arahantship.  From that time the Buddha declared him foremost among exhorters of the nuns.  [A.i.25. The sermon he preached is known as the Nandakovada Sutta (q.v.).  The Anguttara Commentary (i.173) says that the nuns were Sakyan maidens who had entered the Order with Pajapati.  At first Nandaka was reluctant to preach to them, they having been his wives in a previous birth when he was king, and he feared the calumny of his colleagues who might suggest that he wished to see his former companions.  He, therefore, sent another monk in his place; but the Buddha, knowing that only Nanda's preaching would effect the nuns' release, insisted on his going.] [/p][p]The Theragāthā (vs.279 82) contains several verses uttered by him to a woman to whom he was once married.  She met him begging alms in Savatthi and smiled to him with sinful heart.[/p][p]His aspiration after eminence was formed in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, when he heard a disciple of that Buddha declared foremost among exhorters of nuns.  He offered the Buddha a very costly robe and illuminated his bodhi tree.  In the time of Kakusandha Buddha he was a karavīka bird and delighted the Buddha with his song.  Later, he was a peacock, and sang three times daily at the door of a Pacceka Buddha's cell.  (ThagA.  i.384f.  The Apadana verses given in this context differ from those given in the Apadana itself (ii 499 f.).[/p][p][/p][p]The Anguttara Nikaya attributes two discourses to Nandaka.  The first (A.i.193f.  See sv., Sālha) was preached at the Migāramātupasāda and takes the form of a discussion with Sālha, Migāra's grandson, and Rohana, Pekkhuniya's grandson on greed, covetousness, malice and delusion, and the benefits following their destruction.  The second discourse is a sermon addressed to the monks at the waiting hall at Jetavana.  It is said that the Buddha was attracted to the spot by the sound of Nandaka's preaching, and, finding the door locked, stood fur a long time outside, listening (A.iv.358ff.; throughout the three watches of the night says the Commentary, AA.ii.794; also MA.i.348).  When his back began to ache he knocked at the door, and, having entered, told Nandaka that he had been waiting until the end of his discourse to speak to him.  Nandaka expressed.  his regret that he should have kept the Buddha waiting and pleaded ignorance of his presence.  The Buddha, conscious of Nandaka's remorse, went on to praise his sermon, and said that the preaching of such sermons was the duty of all pious monks.  When the Buddha left, Nandaka resumed his sermon, and told his audience of the five results of listening to the Dhamma in due season.[/p][p]The Majjhima Commentary (ii.1019) states that Nandaka was once the leader of a guild of five hundred slaves of Benares and that Pajapati Gotami was his wife.  One day, while fetching water, his wife noticed five hundred Pacceka Buddhas enter the city, and, on her return, she witnessed their departure.  On enquiry, she learnt that they had applied to a merchant for lodgings for the rainy season, but that he had been unable to help.  She undertook the care of them and, having enlisted the support of all her companions and their husbands, she and her husband ministered to the Pacceka Buddhas.  As a result, they were born together as man and wife for many births, as were their helpers.  In one birth Nandaka was king, and all the women became his wives.  In this birth, the women were born as Pajapati's companions, and they left the world in her company.  To them was the Nandakovada Sutta preached.[/p][hr][h4]2. Nandaka Thera[/h4][p]A householder of Campā and younger brother of Bharata Thera.  When these two heard that Sona Kolivisa had left the world and he so delicate they too renounced household life.  Bharata soon acquired sixfold abhiññā, and, wishing to help Nandaka, came to him and discoursed on insight.  A caravan passed by, and an ox, unable to pull his cart through a boggy place, fell down.  The caravan leader had him released and fed with grass and water.  He was then able to pull the cart out.  Bharata drew Nandaka's attention to the incident, and the latter, making that his object of meditation, soon attained arahantship.  (Thag.173f.; ThagA.i.299f.)[/p][p]In the time of Sikhī Buddha, Nandaka was a woodsman, and one day, while wandering about, he saw the Buddha's cloistered walk.

The Buddha wished Nanda good fortune and handed him his bowl to be taken to the vihāra.  Nanda, thereupon, accompanied the Buddha out of the palace.  Janapadakalyānī, seeing him go, asked him to return quickly.  Once inside the vihāra, however, the Buddha asked Nanda to become a monk, and he, unable to refuse the request, agreed with reluctance.  But as the days passed he was tormented with thoughts of his beloved, and became very downcast and despondent, and his health suffered.  The Buddha suggested that they should visit the Himālaya.  On the way there, he showed Nanda the charred remains of a female monkey and asked him whether Janapadakalyānī were more beautiful than that.  The answer was in the affirmative.  The Buddha then took him to Tāvatimsa where Sakka, with his most beautiful nymphs, waited on them.  In answer to a question by the Buddha, Nanda admitted that these nymphs were far more attractive than Janapadakalyānī, and the Buddha promised him one as wife if he would live the monastic life.  Nanda was all eagerness and readily agreed.  On their return to Jetavana the Buddha related this story to the eighty chief disciples, and when they questioned Nanda, he felt greatly ashamed of his lustfulness.  Summoning all his courage, he strove hard and, in no long time, attained arahantship.  He thereupon came to the Buddha and absolved him from his promise.

[/p][p]When the Buddha was told of Nanda's arahantship by a devata, he related the Sangāmāvacara Jataka (q.v.) to show how, in the past, too, Nanda had been quick to follow advice.  He also related the story of Kappata (q.v.) and his donkey to show that it was not the first time that Nanda had been won to obedience by the lure of the female sex.  The male donkey in the story was Nanda and the female donkey Janapadakalyānī.  (DhA.i.103f.)[/p][p]Nanda is identified with the sub king (uparājā) in the Kurudhamma Jataka (q.v.).[/p][p]Later, on seeing how eminently Nanda was trained in self control, the Buddha declared him chief among his disciples in that respect (indriyesu guttadvārānam).  Nanda had aspired to this eminence in the time of Padumuttara Buddha.  In the time of Atthadassi Buddha he was a tortoise in the river Vinatā, and, seeing the Buddha on the bank waiting to cross, he took him over to the other side on his back.  (A.i.25; AA.i.174f.; ThagA.i.276ff.) [/p][p]He is said to have been called Nanda because his birth brought joy to his kinsmen.  The Apadāna (i.57) says he was of golden hue, as reward for a gift of a costly robe given by him to Padumuttara.  One hundred thousand kappas ago he became king four times under the name of Cela.  Sixty thousand kappas ago he was again king in four births, under the name of Upacela.  Later, five thousand kappas ago, he was four times cakkavatti, and his name then, too, was Cela.[/p][p]Nanda was very beautiful, and was only four inches shorter than the Buddha.  He once wore a robe made according to the dimensions of the Buddha's robe.  Discovering this, the Buddha chided him for his presumption.  (Vin.iv.173; perhaps this is another version of the story found at S.ii.281. There, Nanda is said to have donned a robe which was pressed on both sides, painted his face, and gone to see the Buddha, carrying a bright bowl.  The Buddha chided him, and Nanda thereupon became a forest dweller and a rag-robe-man.  Buddhaghosa (SA.ii.174) says that Nanda dressed himself up in order to evoke some comment from the Buddha - either approval, so that he might dress thus for the remainder of his life, or censure, in which case he would put on rag robes and dwell in the forest.)

Cakkavatti kings are born in Tāvatimsa after death and spend their time in Nandanavana (S.v.342).  It is said (E.g., J.i.49) that there is a Nandanavana in each deva world.  The devas go there just before their death and disappear in the midst of their revels.

In Nandanavana is a lake called Nandana (J.ii.189) and evidently also a palace called Ekapundarīkavimāna (MT.568).  Nandanavana was so called because it awoke delight in the hearts of all who visited it (J.v.158).

Kappa was a vihāragaruka that is, he attached importance to keeping to his cell.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Nālāgiri[/div][p]An elephant of the royal stalls at Rājagaha.  Devadatta, after several vain attempts to kill the Buddha, obtained Ajātasattu's consent to use Nālagiri as a means of encompassing the Buddha's death.  The elephant, he said, knows nothing of the Buddha's virtues and will have no hesitation in destroying him.  Nālagiri was a fierce animal, and in order to increase his fierceness, Devadatta instructed his keeper to give him twice his usual amount of toddy.  Proclamation was made, by the beating of drums, that the streets of the city should be cleared as Nālāgiri would be let loose upon them.  When the Buddha was informed of this and warned against going into the city for alms, he ignored the warning, and went into Rājagaha with the monks of the eighteen monasteries of the city.  At the sight of Nālāgiri all the people fled in terror.  Ananda, seeing the elephant advancing towards the Buddha, went, in spite of the Buddha's orders to the contrary, and stood in front of the Buddha, who had to make use of his supernatural power to remove him from his place.  Just then, a woman, carrying a child, saw the elephant coming and fled, in her terror dropping the child at the Buddha's feet.  As the elephant was about to attack the child, the Buddha spoke to him, suffusing him with all the love at his command, and, stretching out his right hand, he stroked the animal's forehead.  Thrilling with joy at the touch, Nālāgiri sank on his knees before the Buddha, and the Buddha taught him the Dhamma.  It is said that had the elephant not been a wild beast he would have become a sotāpanna.  Marvelling at the sight, the assembled populace threw all their ornaments on the elephant's body, covering it entirely, and henceforth the elephant was known as Dhanapāla (Dhanapālaka).  The Buddha returned to Veluvana, and that day, at eventide, preached the Cullahamsa Jātaka in praise of Ananda's loyalty to himself (Vin.ii.194f.: J.v.333ff.; Avedānas i.  177).  It is said (Mil.  349) that nine hundred million living beings, who saw the miracle, realized the Truth.[/p][p]The Bodhisatta, in a past life, was once riding an elephant when he saw a Pacceka Buddha.  Intoxicated by his own glory, he made the elephant charge the Pacceka Buddha.  It was as a result of this action that the Buddha, in this birth, was charged by Nālāgiri (UdA.265; Ap.i.300).  cp.

Eighteen kappas ago, in the time of Piyadassī Buddha, he left great riches and became an ascetic, dwelling in a sāla grove.  Once, seeing the Buddha wrapped in samādhi, he built a bower over him, and stood there with clasped hands until the Buddha awoke from his samādhi.  Then, at the Buddha's wish, the Sangha too came to the sāla grove, and in their presence the Buddha predicted the ascetic's future (ThagA.i.74f; Thag.21).[/p][p]Nigrodha is probably identical with Sālamandapiya of the Apadāna.

He was the son of Sumana, the eldest of Bimbisāra's children, and his mother was Sumanā.  When Asoka slew Sumana, his wife, who was with child, fled to a candāla village, where the guardian deity of a nigrodha tree built her a hut.  Here she gave birth to her son, whom she named after her benefactor.  The chief candāla looked after them.  When Nigrodha was seven years old, the Thera Mahāvaruna ordained him, and he became an arahant in the tonsure hall.  One day, while walking near the palace, Asoka saw him and, because of their connection in a past life, was attracted by him.  Nigrodha had been one of the three brothers who gave honey to a Pacceka Buddha in a past life (for the story see Asoka and Mhv.v.49ff).  Nigrodha had called the Pacceka Buddha a candāla, hence he was born in a candāla village.  Asoka invited Nigrodha to the palace and entertained him, and Nigrodha preached to him the Appamāda Vagga.  The king was greatly pleased, and offered to give food daily at the palace to thirty two monks in Nigrodha's name.  It was this visit of Nigrodha to Asoka which ultimately resulted in the conversion of the latter to the faith of the Buddha (for details see ibid., 37 72; Dpv.vi.34ff.; vii.12, 31; Sp.i.45ff).  It is said (MA.ii.931) that Asoka paid great honour to Nigrodha throughout his life.  Three times a day he sent to Nigrodha gifts of robes carried on the backs of elephants, with five hundred measures of perfume and five hundred caskets of garlands.  All these Nigrodha would distribute among his colleagues, and most of the monks of Jambudīpa at that time wore robes, which were the gift of Nigrodha.[/p][hr][h4]7. Nigrodha[/h4][p]Called Māragiri.

On being asked where he went, he would say "to my teacher." One day he became an arahant, and when asked why he no longer went to his teacher, he answered that the need was no more.  This was reported to the Buddha, who praised the monk for his self-admonition.  DhA.iv.115 17.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Nakulapitā [/div][hr][h4]Nakulapitā and Nakulamātā[/h4][p]A man and his wife, householders of Sumsumāragiri in the Bhagga-country.  When the Buddha visited the village and stayed at Bhesakalāvana, they went to see him.  They immediately fell at his feet, calling him "son" and asking why he had been so long away.  It is said that they had been the Bodhisatta's parents for five hundred births and his near relations for many more.  The Buddha preached to them and they became sotāpannas.  The Buddha visited their village once more when they were old.  They entertained him, telling of their devotion to each other in this life and asking for a teaching which should keep them likewise together in after-life.  The Buddha referred to this in the assembly of the Sangha, declaring them to be the most intimate companions (vissāsikā) among his disciples.  (A.I.26, A.II.61f, AA.i.216f, 246; ii.514; SA.ii.182)[/p][p]Once, when Nakulapitā lay grievously ill, his wife noticed that he was fretful with anxiety.  She assured him there was no need for anxiety on his part, either on behalf of her or his children.  She spoke with such conviction that Nakulapitā regained his composure of mind and grew well.  Later he visited the Buddha and told him of this, and was congratulated by the Buddha on having such an excellent wife.  (A.III.295ff)[/p][p]The Samayutta Nikaya (S.3.1, S.4.116; A.IV.268) contains records of conversations between Nakulapitā and the Buddha.  Both husband and wife are mentioned in lists of eminent disciples.  (A.iii.465; A.iv.348).[/p][p]It is said that' Nakulapitā's desire for eminence was first conceived in the time of Padamuttara Buddha.  He was then a householder of Hamsavati, and was present at an assembly where the Buddha declared someone to be chief of the vissāsikas.

Nakulapitā Sutta[/h4][p]Nakulapitā visits the Buddha at Bhesakalāvana and asks him why some beings are wholly set free in this very life, while others are not.

When Nāgita, the Buddha's personal attendant at the time, told him the cause of the clamour, the Buddha replied that he had nothing to do with homage; his concern was with renunciation.  He went on to state five inevitable things: whosoever eats and drinks must answer the calls of nature; whosoever loves is destined to sorrow and despair; whosoever dwells on the asubha must feel disgust for the subha; whosoever sees impermanence in the six spheres of contact feels disgust for contact; whosoever sees the rise and fall in the five kinds of attachment, must feel disgust for attachment.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Nandiya [/div][hr][h4]1. Nandiya Thera[/h4][p]He belonged to a Sākiyan family of Kapilavatthu, and was called Nandiya because his birth brought bliss.  He left the world at the same time as Anuruddha, Kimbila and the others, and he soon attained arahantship.  Thereafter he dwelt with his companions in the Pācīnavamsamigadāya (Vin.i.350f.  It was to them that the Upakkilesa Sutta was preached, M.iii.155. Later, they seem to have lived in the Gosingasālavana, M.i.205).  It is said that Mars appeared before him in a terrible form, but Nandiya drove him away.[/p][p]In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Nandiya built an altar of sandalwood at the Buddha's cetiya and held great celebrations.  Fifteen kappas ago Nandiya was eight times born as king under the name of Samatta (Samagga) (Thag.25; ThagA.82f.) He is probably identical with Saparivāriya (q.v.) of the Apadāna (i.172).[/p][p]According to the Mahāvastu (iii.177) Nandiya (Nandika) was the son of Sukrodana.[/p][p]He was a special friend of Kimbila.  ThagA.i.276.[/p][hr][h4]2. Nandiya[/h4][p]A Sakyan layman, evidently to be distinguished from the above.  He visited the Buddha at the Nigrodhārāma in Kapilavatthu and had a discussion with him on the different kinds of Ariyan disciple, the one who dwells in remissness and the one who is earnest (S.v.397ff.; see also p.  403).  Later, when the Buddha returned to Sāvatthi for the rainy season, Nandiya also went there, finding some business to do, and from time to time he visited the Buddha.  At the end of the rains, when the Buddha and the monks were about to start on tour, Nandiya went to the Buddha and was taught the eleven conditions which lead to the destruction of evil.  A.v.334ff.[/p][hr][h4]3. Nandiya[/h4][p]A householder of Benarea.  He was very pious and looked after his parents.  When they wished him to marry Revatī, he refused because she belonged to a family of unbelievers.  But when Revatī offered to help Nandiya in all his work, he agreed and they were married.  When Nandiya's parents died, leaving him very rich, he used the money to feed the poor and needy.  Later he built a quadruple hall in the great monastery at Isipatana and furnished it with great splendour.  On the day of its dedication to the Buddha and the monks, as the water of donation fell on the Buddha's hand, there arose in Tāvatimsa a celestial mansion, measuring twelve leagues in each direction, for Nandiya's use.  During one of Moggallāna's visits to Tāvatimsa he saw this mansion, and was told by many nymphs that they were awaiting Nandiya's arrival (DhA.iii.290ff).  The Vimāna Vatthu Commentary (VvA.222f ) goes on to say that after a life devoted to good deeds Nandiya died, and was born in his celestial mansion, and that Revatī, on the death of her husband, stopped the gifts of alms, abused the monks, and was cast alive into the Ussada niraya by the orders of Vessavana.[/p][hr][h4]4.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Nāgadīpa[/div][p]A province of Ceylon, identified with the modern Jaffna peninsula and the north west of Ceylon.  [/p][p]The Buddha's second visit to Ceylon was to Nāgadīpa, to settle a dispute between two Nāgas, Mahodara and Cūlodara (Mhv.i.47).  [/p][p]Jambukola (q.v.) was a harbour in Nāgadīpa, and there a vihāra was built by Devānampiyatissa (Ibid., xx.25) and later restored by Kanitthatissa (Ibid., xxxvi.9).  This vihāra was probably called Tissa vihāra (See ibid.,36).  [/p][p]Another vihāra, called Sālipabbata, was built by Mahallaka Nāga (Ibid.,xxxv.124).  The Unnalomaghara, the Rājāyatana dhātucetiya and the Amalacetiya were probably all places of worship in Nāgadīpa (Cv.xlii.62).  [/p][p]The Valāhassa Jātaka (J.ii.128) says that the coast of Ceylon, from the river Kalyānī to Nāgadīpa, was once infested by yakkhinis.  Once (J.iii.187) Nāgadīpa was known as Serumadīpa, and near by was Karadīpa, earlier known as Ahidīpa (J.iv.238).  [/p][p]An old story, given in the Commentaries (E.g., VibhA.444), speaks of a king called Dīparāgā, who reigned over Nāgadīpa in great splendour.  Nāgadīpa was once an important centre of Buddhism in Ceylon (E.g., ibid., 446, 467; AA.i.422. MA.i.545; see also J.R.A.S., vol.  xxvi) and contained many places of pilgrimage.  There is a legend (DA.iii.899; VibhA.433) which relates that, when the Buddha's sāsana comes to an end, all the Buddha's relics in Ceylon will gather together at the Mahācetiya and travel to the Rājāyatanacetiya in Nāgadīpa, and then from there to the Mahābodhi tree at Gayā.[/p][p]According to the Rasavāhinī (ii.19) the place was so called because it was given as gift to the woman named Nagā.

The monks retired to Mucalindavana and developed arahantship before eating.  The deity of the king's parasol shouted applause, and the king, having heard the story, gave Nāgā the whole island, which thus came to be called Nāgādipa.  Ras.ii.16f.  [/p][hr][h4]8. Nāgā[/h4][p]A class of beings classed with Garulas and Supannas and playing a prominent part in Buddhist folk lore.  They are gifted with miraculous powers and great strength.  Generally speaking, they are confused with snakes, chiefly the hooded Cobra, and their bodies are described as being those of snakes, though they can assume human form at will.  They are broadly divided into two classes: those that live on land (thalaja) and those that live on water (jalaja).  The Jalaja-nāgā live in rivers as well as in the sea, while the Thalaja-nāgā are regarded as living beneath the surface of the earth.  Several Nāga dwellings are mentioned in the books: e.g., Mañjerika-bhavana under Sineru, Daddara-bhavana at the foot of Mount Daddara in the Himālaya, the Dhatarattha-nāgā under the river Yamunā, the Nābhāsā Nāgā in Lake Nabhasa, and also the Nāgas of Vesāli, Tacchaka, and Payāga (D.ii.258).  The Vinaya (ii.109) contains a list of four royal families of Nāgas (Ahirājakulāni): Virūpakkhā, Erāpathā, Chabyāputtā and Kanhagotamakā.  Two other Nāga tribes are generally mentioned together: the Kambalas and the Assataras.  It is said (SA.iii.120) that all Nāgas have their young in the Himālaya.[/p][p]Stories are given - e.g., in the Bhūridatta Jātaka - of Nāgas, both male and female, mating with humans; but the offspring of such unions are watery and delicate (J.vi.160).  The Nāgas are easily angered and passionate, their breath is poisonous, and their glance can be deadly (J.vi.160, 164).  They are carnivorous (J.iii.361), their diet consisting chiefly of frogs (J.vi.169), and they sleep, when in the world of men, on ant hills (ibid., 170).  The enmity between the Nāgas and the Garulas is proverbial (D.ii.258).  At first the Garulas did not know how to seize the Nāgas, because the latter swallowed large stones so as to be of great weight, but they learnt how in the Pandara Jātaka (q.v.).  The Nāgas dance when music is played, but it is said (J.vi.191) that they never dance if any Garula is near (through fear) or in the presence of human dancers (through shame).[/p][p]The best known of all Nāgas is Mahākāla, king of Mañjerika-bhavana (q.v.).  He lives for a whole kappa, and is a very pious follower of the Buddha.  The Nāgas of his world had the custodianship of a part of the Buddha's relics till they were needed for the Māha Thūpa (Mhv.xxxi.27f.), and when the Bodhi tree was being brought to Ceylon they did it great honour during the voyage (Mbv.  p..  163f.).  Other Nāga kings are also mentioned as ruling with great power and majesty and being converted to the Buddha's faith - e.g., Aravāla, Apalālā, Erapatta, Nandopananda, and Pannaka.  (See also Ahicchatta and Ahināga.) In the Atānātiya Sutta (D.iii.198f.), speaking of dwellers of the Cātummahārajika world, the Nāgas are mentioned as occupying the Western Quarter, with Virūpokkha as their king.[/p][p]The Nāgas had two chief settlements in Ceylon, in Nāgadīpa (q.v.) and at the mouth of the river Kalyānī.  It was to settle a dispute between two Nāga chiefs of Nāgadīpa, Mahodara and Cūlodara, that the Buddha paid his second visit to Ceylon.  During that visit he made a promise to another Nāga-king, Manjakkhika of Kalyānī, to pay him a visit, and the Buddha's third visit was in fulfilment of that undertaking (Mhv.i.48f.).[/p][p]The Nāgas form one of the guards set up by Sakka in Sineru against the Asuras (J.i.204).  The Nāgas were sometimes worshipped by human beings and were offered sacrifices of milk, rice, fish, meat and strong drink (J.i.497f.).  The jewel of the Nāgas is famous for its beauty and its power of conferring wishes to its possessor (J.vi.179, 180).[/p][p]The word Nāga is often used as an epithet of the Buddha and the Arahants, and in this connection the etymology given is āgum na karotī ti Nāgo (e.g., MNid.201).  The Bodhisatta was born several times as king of the Nāgas: Atula, Campeyya, Bhūridatta, Mahādaddara, and Sankhapāla.[/p][p]In the accounts given of the Nāgas, there is undoubtedly great confusion between the Nāgas as supernatural beings, as snakes, and as the name of certain non Aryan tribes, but the confusion is too difficult to unravel.[/p]</e>

People, seeing him, express their wonder and admiration of the noble animal.  [/p][p]Udāyī (Kāludāyī, says the Commentary, AA.ii.669), who is near by, asks the Buddha if it is only the elephant whom people praise for his bulk or do they praise other bulky things as well? They do, says the Buddha., praise all huge things - horses, bulls, snakes, brew, and big men, calling them Nāgas, but really, the best Nāga is he who commits no enormity in word or thought (āgun na karoti, tamnāgo).  Thereupon Udāyi breaks forth into song, praising the Buddha's teaching, comparing the Buddha to an elephant, each limb representing a different virtue (A.iii.345).

  <e>[div class="huge"]Sudhābhojana Jātaka (No.  535)[/div][p]There once lived in Benares a wealthy householder, worth eighty crores.  He offered his wealth to the king, who, however, had no need for it; so he gave much away in gifts and was born as Sakka.  Equally generous were his descendants - Canda, Suriya, Mātali and Pañcasikha.  But the next in descent, Pañcasikha's son, Maccharikosiya, became a miser.  He stopped all giving and lived in abject poverty.  One day, seeing his sub-treasurer eating rice porridge, he wished for some himself, but, owing to his miserliness, he went in disguise to the river with a little rice and there started to cook it with the help of a slave.  Sakka saw this, and, accompanied by Canda and the others, appeared before him disguised as a brahmin.  Advancing towards him, Sakka asked him the way to Benares, and, pretending to be deaf, approached the place where the porridge was being cooked and asked for some.  Maccharikosiya refused to give him any, but Sakka insisted on reciting to him some stanzas on the value of giving, and then Kosiya agreed to give him a little porridge.  One by one the others, also disguised as brahmins, approached, and, in spite of all his efforts, Kosiya was forced to invite them to share his meal.  He asked them to fetch small leaves, but in their hands small leaves became large.  After the porridge had been served, Pañcasikha assumed the form of a dog, then of a horse of changing colours, and started chasing Kosiya, while the others stood motionless in the air.  Kosiya asked how beings could gain such powers, and Sakka explained to him and revealed their identity.  Maccharikosiya went back to Benares and gave away his wealth in charity.  Later he became a hermit and lived in a hut.[/p][p]At that time the four daughters of Sakka - Asā, Saddhā, Sirī and Hirī - went to Anotatta to play in the water.  There they saw Nārada under a pāricchattaka-flower, which served him as a sunshade, and each asked him for the flower.  Nārada said he would give it to the best of them, and referred them to Sakka.  Sakka sent (by Mātali) a cup of ambrosia (sudhābhojana) to Kosiya, and said that whichever of his daughters succeeded in persuading Kosiya to share with her his drink would be adjudged the best.  He listened to all their claims and decided in favour of Hirī.  Sakka, wishing to know why he decided thus, sent Mātali in his chariot to ask him.  While Mātali was yet speaking to him, Kosiya died and was reborn in Tāvatimsa.  Sakka gave him Hirī as wife and also a share of the kingdom of Tāvatimsa.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to a monk of Sāvatthi, who was so generous that he would give away his own food and drink and so starve.  He is identified with Maccharikosiya, Uppalavannā with Hirī, Anuruddha with Pañcasikha, Ananda with Mātali, Kassapa with Suriya, Moggallāna with Canda, Sāriputta with Nārada, and Sakka with the Buddha himself.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Subha[/div][hr][p][b]1. Subha.[/b] A Pacceka Buddha.  M.iii.70; ApA.i.106.[/p][hr][p][b]2. Subha.[/b] A young man (mānava) called Todeyyaputta.  He once visited the Buddha in Sāvatthi, asking him various questions.  The interview is described in the Subha Sutta (q.v.).  At the end of the discourse he declared himself the Buddha's follower.  While on his way back from the city, he met Jānussoni, and, on being asked what he thought of the Buddha, spoke of him in terms of the highest praise, saying that none but Gotama's own peer could utter sufficient praise of him (M.i.196f., 208f.; Jānussoni addresses him as Bhāradvāja).  Subha is described (MA.ii.802; cf.  M.i.202) as the son of the brahmin Todeyya (q.v.) of Tudigāma.[/p][p]Elsewhere however, a different account is given of his conversion.  (DA.ii.384f.; cf.  MA.ii.963f., which adds that the Buddha proved the identity of the dog by getting it to indicate the place where Todeyya's treasure lay buried).  Subba's father was a very rich merchant, chaplain to Pasenadi, but a great miser.  After death he was born as a dog in the same home.  One day, when the Buddha was going his alms round in Tudigāma near Sāvatthi, he arrived at Subha's house.  The dog saw the Buddha and barked, and the Buddha addressed it as "Todeyya." The dog thereupon ran into the house and lay on a bed, from which no one could drive it away.  When Subha asked the cause of the uproar, he was told the story.  Thereupon he was very angry, saying that his father had been born in the Brahmaloka, and, in order to refute the Buddha, he visited the monastery.  This was the occasion for the preaching of the Subha Sutta.  Soon after the Buddha's death, when Ananda, was staying in Sāvatthi, Subha sent a young man to Ananda, with his respects and an invitation to his house.  Ananda, having taken medicine, did not go that day.  But he went the next day, accompanied by a monk of Cetiya (Cetaka).  Their conversation is recorded in the Subha Sutta (2) (D.i.204f).  See also Cūlakammavibhahga Sutta, which too was preached to Subha.[/p][hr][p][b]3. Subha.[/b] A palace guard, son of Datta.  He closely resembled King Yasalālaka-Tissa in appearance, and the king used to place him on the throne, decked in royal ornaments, and watch the ministers doing obeisance to him, while he himself took the guard's place.  One day, while Subha was on the throne, he reprimanded the king, disguised as a guard, for smiling disrespectfully, and had him led away and executed before the truth was discovered.  Subha then became king and ruled for six years (120-6 A.C.).  He built the Subharāja-parivena, the Vallī-vihāra, the Ekadvāra vihāra and the Nandīgāmaka-vihāra.  He was deposed by Vasabha (Mhv.xxxv.51ff.; Dpv.xxi.45).  His daughter married Vankanāsika-Tissa.  She had been adopted by a bricklayer, but Vasabha discovered her identity and married her to his son.  Her good fortune was owing to a meal she had given to an arahant thera.

[/p][p]Once, when he was performing Fire-rites on the banks of the Sundarikā, he looked round to see if there were anyone, to whom he could give what was left over from the oblations.  He saw the Buddha seated under a tree, his head covered; (to rouse the brahmin's curiosity and to prevent him from being repelled by the sight of a shaven head, says the Commentary) he approached him with the oblation and a water pitcher and addressed him.  The Buddha uncovered his head.  The sight of the shaven head at first made Sundarika draw back, but, realizing that some brahmins too were shaved, he questioned the Buddha about his birth.  The Buddha explained to him that the important thing was not birth, but the leading of a good life.  The brahmin was pleased and offered him the oblation, but the Buddha refused it, saying that he did not accept presents for chanting verses.  He advised Sundarika to throw the food into the water, where there were no creatures, for who could digest food which had once been offered to a Buddha? The brahmin followed this advice and saw the water hiss and seethe with steam and smoke.  Alarmed and with hair on end, he worshipped the Buddha, who preached to him.  Sundarika entered the Order and became an arahant.  S.i.167f.  The account of the meeting between the Buddha and Sundarika is given in the Sutta Nipāta too (p.79 f.), but there the details differ greatly, though the topic of discussion is the same.

The Commentary calls the SN.  discourse the Pūralāsa Sutta (SNA.ii.400).[/p][p]Sundarika-Bhāradvāja was so called from his habit of offering oblations on the banks of the Sundarikā (SA.i.181f).  He is also mentioned (M.i.39f) as meeting the Buddha on the banks of the Bāhukā and asking him whether he bathed in that river, because it had the reputation of cleansing sins.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Siri Jātaka (No.  284)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta was once an ascetic and had, as patron, an elephant trainer.  A stick gatherer, sleeping at night in a temple, heard two cocks, roosting on a tree near by, abusing each other.  In the course of the quarrel one cock boasted that whoever ate his flesh would be king; his exterior, commander in chief or chief queen; his bones, royal treasurer or king's chaplain.  The man killed the cock and his wife cooked it; then, taking it with them, they went to the river to bathe.  They left the meat and the rice on the bank, but, as they bathed, a breeze blew the pot holding the food into the river.  It floated down stream, where it was picked up by the elephant trainer.  The Bodhisatta saw all this with his divine eye and visited the trainer at meal time.  There he was offered the meat and divided it, giving the flesh to the trainer, the exterior to his wife, and keeping the bones for himself.  Three days later the city was besieged by enemies.  The king asked the trainer to don royal robes and mount the elephant, while he himself fought in the ranks.  There he was killed by an arrow, and the trainer, having won the battle, was made king, his wife being queen, and the ascetic his chaplain.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to a brahmin who tried to steal Anāthapindika's good fortune (siri).  He perceived that this lay in a white cock, for which he begged.  Anāthapindika gave it to him, but the good fortune left the cock and settled in a jewel.  He asked for that also and was given it.  But the good fortune went into a club.  The club was also asked for, and Anāthapindika giving it, asked the brahmin to take it and be gone.  But the good fortune now settled on Anāthapindika's wife.

Sonuttara visited the Mañjerika-nāga-bhavana and asked the Nāga king, Mahākāla, to give him the relics which he had there and which had once been enshrined in Rāmagāma.  But Mahākāla, unwilling to part with them, told his nephew, Vāsuladatta, to hide them.

Once, in the company of a greedy merchant of the same name, he crossed the Telavāha and entered Andhapura.  In that city was a family fallen on evil days, the sole survivors being a girl and her grandmother.  The greedy merchant went to their house with his wares.  The girl begged her grandmother to buy her a trinket, and suggested that they should give the hawker in exchange the bowl from which they ate.  This was an heirloom and made of gold; but it had lost its lustre, and the women did not know its value.  The hawker was called in and shown the bowl.  He scratched it with a needle and knew it was of gold, but, wishing to have it for nothing, said it was not worth one half farthing.  So saying he threw it away and left.  Later the Bodhisatta came to the same street and was offered the same bowl.  He told them the truth, gave them all the money he had and his stock, leaving only eight pieces of money for himself.  These he gave to a boatman, and entered his boat to cross the river.  Meanwhile the greedy merchant went again to the old woman's house, hoping to get the bowl in exchange for a few trinkets.  When he heard of what had happened he lost command of himself, and, throwing down all he had, ran down to the river, to find the Bodhisatta's boat in mid stream.  He shouted to the boatman to return, but the Bodhisatta urged him on.  The merchant, realizing what he had lost through his greed, was so upset that his heart burst, and he fell down dead.[/p][p]The story was told to a monk who had given up striving.

At the end of the discourse, Sonadanda expressed his appreciation of the Buddha and his doctrine, and invited him and his monks to a meal.  At the conclusion of the meal Sonadanda asked the Buddha to forgive him if, in the presence of the brahmins, he did not make humble obeisance to the Buddha, but merely saluted him.  Buddhaghosa explains (D.i.111ff., DA.i.292ff ) that this was because Sonadanda was much older than the Buddha and did not wish people to see him paying homage to one young enough to be his grandson.  But, probably, Sonadanda's conversion to the faith was only partial.  [/p][p]Angaka (q.v.) was Sonadanda's sister's son.[/p]</e>

Sela.[/b] A brahmin of Anguttarāpa.  He was a great friend of Keniya, the Jatila, and visited him when Keniya was making preparations to entertain the Buddha.  Having heard the word "Buddha" from Keniya, Sela was filled with joy and fortitude, and went with his two hundred and fifty pupils to visit the Buddha in the woodland near Apana.  There he observed on the person of the Buddha the thirty two marks of a Great Being all except two - viz., hidden privates and the long tongue.  The Buddha read his thoughts and contrived, by his iddhi power, that Sela should be satisfied on these two points as well (This is referred to at Mil.167; DA.i.276, etc.).  Sela then praised the Buddha in a series of verses and asked questions of him.  At the end of his talk, Sela entered the Order with his pupils, and, at the end of a week, he attained arahantship (SN.  p.104 ff.  = M.ii.146f).[/p][p]In the time of Padumuttara Buddha Sela had been the leader of the same guild of three hundred men, and, together with them, had built a parivena for the Buddha and done many good acts.  As a result of these they received the "ehi Bhikkhu-pabbajjā" in this last life (SNA.ii.455; MA.ii.782; see also Ap.i.316; Thag.vs.818-41; Th4gA.ii.47f).[/p][p]Mahāsela, mentioned as the teacher of Sugandha Thera (ThagA.i.80f), is probably identical with this Sela.

It was under a sāla tree in Subhagavana that the Mūlapariyāya Sutta was preached (M.i.1; also the Jātakas, of the same name, J.ii.259).[/p][p]The wood was so called because of its beauty.

In his last life he was born in the house of a supporter of Sāriputta.  During her pregnancy, his mother gave alms to five hundred monks, with Sāriputta at their head.  When he was seven years old, he entered the Order under Sāriputta, on which occasion his parents held a special almsgiving lasting for seven days.[/p][p]Once, while going with Sāriputta for alms, he noticed several things, and like the novice Pandita (q.v.) asked the Elder numerous questions.  Then he expressed a wish to return to the monastery.  Sāriputta agreed, and Sukha turned back saying, "Sir, when you bring my food, pray bring me food of one hundred flavours.  If you cannot obtain it through your own merit, you can obtain it through mine." So saying, he returned to his cell and meditated on the nature of the body.  Sakka's throne was heated, and he sent the Four Regent Gods to keep away all noise from Sukha's cell.  He also bade the Sun and Moon stand still.  Sukha, helped by this silence, became an anāgāmī.[/p][p]Meanwhile, Sāriputta had gone to a house where he knew he could get the food desired by Sukha, and, having eaten there, returned with Sukha's portion to the monastery.  The Buddha, thinking that Sāriputta's arrival might impede Sukha's attainment of arahantship, appeared near the gate of Sukha's cell and stood guard.  As he stood there, the Buddha asked Sāriputta four questions.  When the last question was answered, Sukha became an arahant.  Thereupon Sāriputta opened the door and gave Sukha his food.  Sukha ate it and washed the bowl.  The Four Regent God's left their post, Sakka let go the rope of the door of the novice's cell, and the Sun and Moon started once more on their course.  Evening at once came on, and the Buddha, on being asked the reason, explained that it was a usual occurrence when they who possess merit engage in meditation.

(According to ThagA.i.429, his father was a rich setthi; no mention is made there of his mother).  [/p][p]A little while before the birth of the child Kālī went to her parents' house in Rājagaha, and one day, as she was cooling herself, she heard a conversation between two Yakkhas,  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/satagira,Sātāgira')"]Sātāgira[/a] and  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hemavata,Hemavata')"]Hemavata[/a].  As she listened to their talk, her mind was filled with thoughts of the virtues of the Buddha, and she became a sotāpanna.  That same night the child was born and was called Sona.  His mother later returned to  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kuraraghara,Kuraraghara')"]Kuraraghara[/a].  At that time  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kaccaana,Mahā Kaccāna')"]Mahā Kaccāna[/a] lived near by and often visited her home.  Sona was very attached to him, and was later ordained by him.  Three years later he received the upasampadā, and, with Mahā Kaccāna's leave, visited the, Buddha.  Kālī gave him a large carpet to spread in the Buddha's  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhakuti,Gandhakuti')"]Gandhakuti[/a].[/p][p]When Sona arrived at the Gandhakuti, he worshipped the Buddha, who asked  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda,Ananda')"]Ananda[/a] to find him a lodging.  Ananda, reading the Buddha's thoughts, spread a rug in the Buddha's chamber.  Late at night Sona went to bed, and, very early the next morning, the Buddha woke him and asked him to recite the Dhamma.  Sona recited the whole of the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/atthaka_s_v,Atthakavagga')"]Atthakavagga[/a], which he had learnt from Mahā Kaccāna.  At the end of the recital the Buddha applauded him and gave him a boon.  Sona asked for the "Vinaya-dharapañcamaganena upasampadā, which Kaccāna had asked him to choose.  (This means permission to admit a monk into the Order with a chapter of only five monks, one of whom was versed in the Vinaya.  For details of Sona's visit to the Buddha, see Vin.i.194ff.; cf.  Ud.v.6).  Later he returned to Kuraraghara and visited his mother's house.  She had heard of the Buddha's applause from the devas, and wished Sona to recite the Dhamma just as he had done before the Buddha, and this he did.[/p][p]In the time of Padumuttara Buddha Sona had resolved to win this eminence.  In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a member of the Order and sewed a robe for a monk.  Later he was a tailor of Benares and mended a Pacceka Buddha's robe (Thag.vss.365-9; AA.i.133f.; ThagA.i.429).[/p][p]The Dhammapada Commentary says (DhA.iv.103f) that, on the day when Sona recited the Dhamma in Kuraraghara, Kālī went to listen to him, leaving only one female slave in the house.  Her house had seven walls and fortified gates and savage dogs on leash.  Molten lead flowed round the walls at night, and in the night it proved a slippery surface, difficult to walk on.  Nine hundred thieves had been awaiting a chance of breaking into the house, and this day they saw their opportunity.  They stationed one of their number to watch Kālī going to the monastery, and to kill her if she started homewards after the thieves entered her house.  When they came her female servant ran to the monastery to tell her about it.  But she would not be disturbed and sent her back.  Again the servant went, and again she was sent back.  When the thief, stationed near Kālī, saw her extraordinary piety, he was filled with remorse, and, at the end of the sermon, begged her forgiveness.  All the nine hundred thieves joined the Order under Sona Kutikanna, and on the day they became arahants the Buddha appeared before them in a ray of light to encourage them.[/p][p]According to the Udāna Commentary (UdA.307), Sona was called Kutikanna because he wore ear ornaments worth one crore (koti).  It is said that he once went with a caravan to  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ujjenii,Ujjeni')"]Ujjeni[/a], and when the caravan stopped for the night he slept away from the rest of its members.  The caravan started very early and nobody waked Sona.  When he finally awoke, he ran along the road till he came to a large tree.  There he saw an ugly man tearing off his own flesh and eating it.  On enquiry, Sona learnt that he had been a wicked merchant of Bhārukaccha, who had been born as a peta because he had deceived his patrons.  This revelation filled Sona with great misgivings, which were increased by the sight of two peta boys with blood pouring out of their lips.  They had been youths, also of Bhārukaccha, who had found fault with their mother for feeding an arahant monk.  When Sona returned from Ujjeni he consulted Mahā Kaccāna about these things, and resolved to enter the Order.[/p][p]The Vinaya says (Vin.i.195f) that when Kaccāna wished to confer the higher ordination on Sona, it was three years before he could get together the necessary chapter of ten monks.  This was because there were but few monks in  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/avanti,Avanti')"]Avanti[/a] and in the Southern Country; hence Sona's request to the Buddha that he should allow five monks to officiate in Avanti.  Other boons asked for by Sona and allowed by the Buddha were: [/p][ul][li](1) Permission to use, in Avanti, shoes with thick linings, because the soil of Avanti was black and always muddy; [/li][li](2) permission to bath constantly; [/li][li](3) to use skins for coverlets; [/li][li](4) to accept robes set apart for absent monks even after the lapse of ten days.[/li][/ul][p]Sona is evidently identical with Pātihīrasaññaka of the Apadāna (Ap.ii.392).  Gosāla Thera was a friend of Sona Kutikanna.  ThagA.i.79.[/p][hr][p][b] [a name="5"]5[/a].  Sona-Kolivisa Thera[/b], also called [b]Sukhumāla Sona[/b] (AA.ii.679).  He was born in  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/campaa,Campā')"]Campā[/a], his father being Usabhasetthi.  From the time of his conception his father's wealth continued to increase, and, on the day of his birth, the whole town kept festival.  Because in a previous birth he had given a ring, worth one hundred thousand, to a Pacceka Buddha, his body was like burnished gold - hence his name.  (He was evidently called Kolivisa because he was a Koliyan, Ap.i.95, 21).  His hands and feet were soft like bandhujīvaka-flowers, and a fine down grew on them (four inches long on his feet, Ap.i.298) curved "like ear ornaments." He lived in great luxury in three palaces, each having its own season.[/p][p]King  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bimbisara,Bimbisāra')"]Bimbisāra[/a], hearing of him, sent for him and Sona went with eighty thousand fellow townsmen.  [/p][p]In Rājagaha he heard the Buddha preach, and, winning faith, entered the Order with his parents' consent.  The Buddha gave him a subject for meditation, and he went to Sītavana, but many people visited him and he was unable to concentrate.  He strove hard, and, through pacing up and down in meditation, painful sores developed on his feet.  But he won no attainment and was filled with despair.  The Buddha saw this and visited him, and by preaching to him the Vīnūpamovāda Sutta (see Sona Sutta), taught him how to temper energy with calm.  Thus corrected, he put forth fresh effort and attained arahantship (Thag.vss.632).[/p][p]The Vinaya (i.179ff) gives details of Sona's visit to Bimbisāra.  The king, being curious to see Sona's feet, sent for him.  He and his eighty-thousand companions went to see the Buddha, and there they were greatly impressed by the iddhi-power of Sāgata.  Sona then sought the Buddha alone and joined the Order.  After ordination he walked about meditating, his feet bled, and his cankamana was covered with blood "like a slaughter house for oxen." After Sona attained arahantship, the Buddha gave him permission to wear shoes with one lining.  Sona said he had abandoned eighty cartloads of gold and a retinue of seven elephants.  He did not wish, as a monk, to have any luxuries which his colleagues did not share, The Buddha then gave permission to all monks to wear shoes with one lining.[/p][p]In the time of Anomadassī Buddha he was a very rich setthi, and, having gone with others to the vihāra and heard the Buddha preach, he decorated a cankamana for the Buddha and a long hall (dīghasālā) for the monks.  On the cankamana he scattered various flowers, and, above it, he hung canopies.  In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a setthi of Hamsavatī named Sirivaddha.  It was then that he resolved to win eminence as foremost of those who strove energetically (aggam āraddhaviriyānan), and in this he was successful (A.i.24).  After the death of Kassapa Buddha Sona was a householder in Benares, and built a hut by the river for a Pacceka Buddha, whom he looked after during the rainy season.  He was king of the gods for twenty five kappas, and seventy-seven times king among men under the name of Yasodhara.  ThagA.i.544f.; cf.  Ap.i.93f., where he is called Koliyavessa.  The ApA.  confused his story with that of Kutikanna; see also AA.i.130f., where the details are different, especially regarding the honour paid by Sona to the Pacceka Buddha.  Once, on visiting the Pacceka Buddha's cell, he noticed that the ground outside it was muddy; so he spread on the ground a rug worth one hundred thousand, so that the Pacceka Buddha's feet might not be soiled.[/p][p]The Apadāna mentions (Ap.i.298) a Thera, called Sona Kotivīsa, evidently identical with the above, the reason given for the name being that he gave away wealth equal in value to twenty crores (vīsa koti).  His eminence is ascribed to the fact that, in the time of Vipassī Buddha, he made a lena (cave) for the Buddha and his monks and spread it with rugs.  Buddhaghosa (AA.i.130) gives a variant of his name, calling him Kotivessa, and explains this by saying that he belonged to a vessa (merchant) family worth a crore.[/p][p]The Sona Sutta (Cf.  AA.ii.680, where he is described as gandhabbasippe cheko) mentions that Sona was a clever player of the vīnā before he joined the Order.  It was the example of Sona Kolivisa which urged Nandaka and his brother, Bharata, to leave the world.  ThagA.i.299.[/p][hr][p][b]6. Sona.

When Bhaddiya left the world, Sona followed his example and entered the Order.  But he was lazy and not given to meditation.  The Buddha saw this from the Ambavana at Anupiyā and, sending forth a ray of glory, spurred him on.  Sona became agitated, and putting forth effort became an arahant.[/p][p]In the time of Sikhī Buddha he was a forester and gave the Buddha a kuruñjiya-fruit (Thag.vss.193, 194; ThagA.i.316f).

He left the world on an elephant, practised austerities for ten months, and attained enlightenment under a nāga tree, being given a meal of milk rice by Anupamā, daughter of Anupama-setthi of Anoma, and grass for his seat by the Ajīvaka Anupama.  His first sermon was preached in the Mekhala Park, and among his first disciples were his step brother Sarana and the purohita's son Bhāvitatta.  His Twin miracle was performed in Sunandavatī.  The Bodhisatta was a Nāga king Atula.  One of the Buddha's chief assemblies was on the occasion of his solving the questions of King Arindama on Nirodha.[/p][p]Sarana and Bhāvitatta were his chief monks and Sonā and Upasenā his chief nuns.  Udena was his personal attendant.  Varuna and Sarana were his chief lay supporters among men and Cālā and Upacālā among women.  His body was ninety cubits in height, and he died at the age of ninety thousand in Angārāma, where a thūpa of four yojanas was erected over his ashes.

His eminence prompted Ananda (Sumana in that birth) to resolve to be an attendant of some future Buddha.  ThagA.ii.122; see also Ap.i.195.[/p][hr][p][b]3. Sumana.  [/b] Step brother of Padumuttara, Buddha.  He obtained, as boon from the king, the privilege of waiting on the Buddha for three months.  He built in the park of Sobhana a vihāra.  The park belonged to the householder Sobhana, and he built the vihāra, on land for which he gave one hundred thousand.  There he entertained the Buddha and his monks.  Sunanda is identified with Ananda.  ThagA.ii.122f.; AA.i.160f.; SA.ii.168f.[/p][hr][p][b]4. Sumana.[/b] A pupil of Anuruddha.  He represented the monks from Pāveyyaka at the Second Council.

[/b] A garland maker, given as an example of one whose acts bore fruit in this very life (Mil.115, 291, 350; cf.  DhSA.426; PSA.498).  He was Bimbisāra's gardener, and provided the king daily with eight measures of jasmine flowers, for which he received eight pieces of money, One day, while on his way to the palace, he saw the Buddha, and threw two handfuls of flowers into the air, where they formed a canopy over the Buddha's head.  Two handfuls thrown on the right, two on the left and two behind, all remained likewise in the air and accompanied the Buddha as he walked through the city, a distance of three leagues, that all might see the miracle.[/p][p]When Sumana returned home with his empty basket and told his wife what he had done, she was fearful lest the king should punish him.  Going to the palace, she confessed what he had done, and asked for forgiveness for herself as she had had no part in the deed.  Bimbisāra visited the Buddha and then sent for Sumana.  Sumana confessed that when he offered the flowers to the Buddha he was quite prepared to lose his life.  The king gave him the eightfold gift: eight female slaves, eight sets of jewels, eight thousand pieces of money, eight women from the royal harem, and eight villages.[/p][p]In reply to a question by Ananda, the Buddha said that in the future the garland maker would become a Pacceka Buddha, Sumana.  DhA.ii.40f.; KhA.129. According to KhA., the Pacceka Buddha's name will be Sumanissara.[/p][hr][p][b]6. Sumana.  [/b] Chief lay supporter of Kassapa Buddha.

Her wish was fulfilled, the son was born, and she sent her maid, Punnā, to prepare the place for the offering.

There the barber killed some birds and ate them; but the lay disciple refused a share and meditated on the Three Jewels.  The Nāga king of the island, moved by this, turned his body into a ship, and, with the Spirit of the Sea as helmsman, offered to take the lay disciple to Jambudīpa.  The barber also wished to go, but his plea was refused because he was not holy.  Thereupon the lay disciple made over to him the merits of his own virtues, and the barber was taken on board.  Both were conveyed to Jambudīpa, where wealth was provided for them.[/p][p]The story was related to a holy believer who, coming one day to Jetavana, found there none of the ferry boats which crossed the Aciravatī; not wishing to return, he started to walk across the river, his mind full of thoughts of the Buddha.

Then the parents suggested that they should all, at once, become ascetics; this they did, and lived in a pleasant grove in the Himālaya.  After some time, because Nanda brought unripe fruit for his parents in spite of Sona's warning, Sona dismissed him.  Nanda thereupon sought Manoja, and, with his magic power, helped him to win various kingdoms in Jambudīpa, bringing into subjection one hundred and one kings in seven years, seven months and seven days.  All these kings Manoja brought to Brahmavaddhana, where he caroused with them.  Nanda spent his time in the Suvannaguhā in the Himālaya, obtaining his alms from Uttarakuru.  At the end of the seventh day Manoja looked for Nanda, who, reading his thoughts, appeared before him.  Manoja wished to give some token of his gratitude, and Nanda asked that he should intercede for him with Sona and win for him Sona's forgiveness.  Together they went to Sona accompanied by a large retinue.  Sona explained why he had forbidden Nanda, to look after their parents, and Nanda asked his forgiveness for having given his parents unripe fruit in his eagerness to wait on them.

One day he saw a forester of Benares who had lost his way, and, feeling compassion for him, took him to his own dwelling, fed him with all kinds of fruit, and then, taking him to the edge of the forest, set him on his way to Benares.  The wretched man noted all the landmarks, and, on reaching the city, entered into an agreement with ivory workers to supply them with Sīlava's tusks.  He then returned to the forest and begged Sīlava for a part of his tusks, pleading poverty and lack of livelihood.  Sīlava allowed the ends of his tusks to be sawn off.  The man returned again and again, until, at last, Sīlava allowed him to dig out the stumps as well.  As the man was on his way back to Benares, the earth opened and swallowed him up into the fires of hell.  A tree sprite, who had witnessed all this, spoke a stanza illustrating the evils of ingratitude.[/p][p]The story was related in reference to Devadatta's wickedness; he is identified with the forester and Sāriputta with the tree sprite (J.i.319-22; the story is referred to in the Milinda-Pañha, p.202).[/p][p]The birth as Sīlava is mentioned among those in which the Bodhisatta practised sīla pāramitā to perfection.  E.g., MA.ii.617.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Somamitta Thera[/div][p]He belonged to a brahmin family of Benares and was expert in the Vedas.  Later, owing to his association with Vimala Thera, he entered the Order and lived with him.  (But according to ThagA.i.377, Vimala was ordained by Somamitta).  But finding Vimala given to sloth and laziness, Somamitta left him and joined Mahā Kassapa, under whose direction he soon attained arahantship.  Later he visited Vimala and rebuked him.  Vimala then put forth effort and became an arahant.[/p][p]Somamitta was a householder in the time of Sikhī Buddha, and, very pleased with the Buddha, he picked some kimsuka-flowers from a tree and offered them to him (Thag.vs.147f ; ThagA.i.267f).[/p][p]He is perhaps identical with Kimsukapupphiya Thera of the Apadāna.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Sunakkhatta Sutta[/div][p]Preached at Vesāli to Sunakkhatta, before he joined the Order.  He asks the Buddha if the monks have really won all they profess or if some of them are extravagant in their professions.  The Buddha explains that some of the monks are worldly, their hearts set on material things; others are free from worldly bondage, their hearts set on permanence; yet others on various jhānas; while the last have their hearts set on nibbāna; all these will act according to their beliefs.  The Buddha then explains further, using the simile of a surgeon: a patient is wounded by a poisoned arrow, even when the surgeon has removed the poison the patient must go slowly till the wound is healed.  Craving is the arrow; the wound represents the six sense organs within; ignorance is the poison; mindfulness is the surgeon's probing; Noble Understanding is the surgeon's knife; and the Tathāgata the surgeon.

One day the elephant ate too much and fell ill.  The brahmin went in search of wild fruit for it, but before he could return, the animal was dead.  The ascetic was filled with grief.  Sakka (the Bodhisatta) saw this and, appearing before him, reminded him that it was not for this that he had left wife, wealth and children.[/p][p]The story was related in reference to a monk who had ordained a novice, and, when the latter died, he was full of grief.

He says (SA.i.135) it was so called because it was occupied by soldiers at the beginning of the kappa (pathamakappikānam senāya nivitthokāse patitthitagāmo) or because it was the village of Sujātā's father Senānī (Sujātāya vā pitu Senānī nāma nigamo).

  <e>[div class="huge"]Sopāka [/div][hr][p][b]1. Sopāka Thera.  [/b] He was the son of a very poor woman of Sāvatthi.  While in labour his mother fell into a long and deep swoon, and her kinsfolk, thinking her dead, took her to the cemetery and prepared for cremation.  But a spirit prevented the fire from burning with a storm of wind and rain, and they went away.  The child was safely born and the mother died.  The spirit, in human shape, took the child and put it in the watchman's hut, feeding it for a time.  After that the watchman adopted it, and the child grew up with the watchman's son, Suppiya (q.v.).  He was called Sopāka, (the "waif") because he was born in the cemetery.  When he was seven years old he came under the notice of the Buddha, who visited him in the cemetery.  Gladdened by the Buddha's teaching, he sought his father's consent and entered the Order.  The Buddha gave him, as his subject of meditation, the thought of mettā, and Sopika, developing insight, soon attained arahantship.[/p][p]In the time of Kakusandha Buddha, he was a householder's son and gave the Buddha some bījapūra-fruits.  He also provided three monks with milk rice daily to the end of his life.  In another birth he gave a meal of milk rice to a Pacceka Buddha (Thag.vs.33; ThagA.i.94f).[/p][p]He is perhaps identical with Vibhītakamiñjaya of the Apadāna.  Ap.ii.396.[/p][hr][p][b]2. Sopāka Thera.  [/b] He was born as the child of a cemetery keeper and was therefore called Sopāka.  Others say that he was born in a trader's family and that Sopāka was merely a name.  Four months after birth his father died suddenly and he was adopted by his uncle.  When he was only seven years old, his uncle took him to a charnel field because he quarrelled with his cousin, bound his hands, and tied him fast to a corpse, hoping that the jackals would eat him.  At midnight the jackals came and the child started crying.  The Buddha, seeing Sopāka's destiny for arahantship, sent a ray of glory, and, by the Buddha's power, the boy broke his bonds and stood before the Buddha's Gandhakuti, a sotāpanna.  His mother started seeking for him, and the uncle telling her nothing, she came to the Buddha, thinking "The Buddhas know all, past, present and future." When she came, the Buddha, by his iddhi-power, made the boy invisible and taught her the Dhamma, saying that sons are no shelter, blood bonds no refuge.  As she listened she became a sotāpanna and the boy an arahant.  Then the Buddha revealed the boy's presence to his mother, and she allowed him to enter the Order.  Some time later the Buddha, wishing to confer on him the higher ordination, asked him the questions which came to be known as the "Kumārapañhā" Sopāka answered these, and the Buddha, satisfied, gave him the upasampadā.[/p][p]Sopāka had been a brahmin in the time of Siddhattha Buddha, expert in the Vedas.  He later became an ascetic and lived on a mountain.  The Buddha, foreseeing his imminent death, visited him.  The brahmin spread for him a seat of flowers.  The Buddha preached to him on impermanence and left through the air.  Thag.vss.480-6; ThagA.i.477f.; Ap.i.64f.; KhpA.76; see also DhA.iv.176f.[/p]</e>

When the Buddha died and the monks stood weeping, Subhadda asked them to rejoice instead, saying: "We are well rid of the Mahāsamana; we shall now do just as we like." Mahā Kassapa heard this while he was on his way from Pāvā to Kusināra, and it was this remark which made him decide to hold the First Council after the Buddha's death (Vin.ii.284f; D.ii.162; Mhv.iii.6).[/p][p]Subhadda had been a sāmanera at the time of the Buddha's visit to Atumā, and had two sons before he joined the Order.  When he heard that the Buddha was coming, he sent for his two sons and gave orders for various foods to be collected to feed the Buddha and the twelve hundred and fifty monks.  The Buddha arrived in the evening and took up his residence in Atumā.  All night long Subhadda went about giving instructions regarding the preparation of the food.  In the morning of the next day the Buddha went out for alms, and Subhadda approached him and invited him to partake of the food which he had prepared.  But the Buddha questioned him, and, discovering what he had done, refused to accept the meal, forbidding the monks to do so too.  This angered Subhadda, and he awaited an opportunity of expressing his disapproval of the Buddha.  This opportunity came when he heard of the Buddha's death.  DA.ii.599; cf.

[/b] He was a brahmin of high rank (of the udicca-brāhmana-mahā-sālakula), and, having become a Paribbājaka, was living in Kusinārā when the Buddha went there on his last journey.  Having heard that the Buddha would die in the third watch of the night, Subhadda went to the sāla grove, where the Buddha lay on his death bed, and asked Ananda for permission to see him.  But three times Ananda refused the request, saying that the Buddha was weary.  The Buddha overheard the conversation and asked Subhadda to come in.  Subhadda asked the Buddha if there were any truth in the teachings of other religious instructors.  The Buddha said he had no time to discuss that, but that any system devoid of the Noble Eightfold Path was useless for salvation, and he taught Subhadda the Doctrine.  Subhadda asked to be allowed to join the Order, and the Buddha gave Amanda special permission to admit him at once without waiting for the usual probationary period.  Subhadda dwelt in solitude and in meditation and soon became an arahant.  He was the last disciple to be converted by the Buddha (D.ii.148ff.; cf.  DhA.iii.376f).[/p][p]Buddhaghosa says (DA.ii.590) that when the Buddha gave him permission to ordain Subhadda, Ananda took him outside, poured water over his head, made him repeat the formula of the impermanence of the body, shaved off his hair and beard, clad him in yellow robes, made him repeat the Three Refuges, and then led him back to the Buddha.  The Buddha himself admitted Subhadda to the higher ordination and gave him a subject for meditation.  Subhadda took this and, walking up and down in a quiet part of the grove, attained arahantship and came and sat down beside the Buddha.[/p][p]In the past, Subhadda and Aññāta Kondañña had been brothers.  They had a cornfield, and the elder (Aññāta Kondañña) gave the first fruits of the corn to the monks in nine stages.  The younger (Subhadda) found fault with him for damaging the corn.  They then divided the field, thus settling the dispute (DA.ii.588).  Subhadda rubbed the dead body of Padumuttara Buddha with sandalwood and other fragrant essences and placed a banner on his thūpa.  In the time of Kassapa Buddha, the Buddha's aggasāvaka, Tissa, was, Subhadda's son.  Subhadda spoke disparagingly of him, hence his tardiness in meeting the Buddha in his last life.  Subhadda died on the day of his ordination and arahantship (Ap.i.100f).[/p][p]The conversation between the Buddha and Subhadda forms the topic of a dilemma in the Milinda-Pañha (p.130).

  <e>[div class="huge"]Supatta Jātaka (No.  292)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta was once a crow, named Supatta, king of eighty four thousand crows: His chief mate was Suphassā and his chief companion Sumukha.  One day, while Supatta and Suphassā were out looking for food, they noticed that the king's cook had prepared a host of dishes and had left some of them out in the open to cool.  Suphassā sniffed at the food but said nothing.  The next day, however, she wished to stay behind and taste some of the king's food.  Supatta consulted his captain, and they went with a large number of crows, whom they set in groups round the kitchen.  As the cook was taking the dishes on a pingo, Sumukha, as arranged, attacked him with beak and claw and made him drop them.  Then the crows ate their fill and flew away with food for Supatta and Suphassā.  Sumukha was caught and taken before the king, who has seen what had happened.  When questioned by the king, he told him the whole story and said that he would gladly lose his life for his king, Supatta.  The king sent for Supatta and listened to his preaching, and, thereafter protecting all creatures, practised the good life.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to Sāriputta, who had obtained from Pasenadi a meal of red rice and new ghee, flavoured with red fish, because he had been informed by Rāhula that Bimbādevi (Rāhulamātā) suffered from gastric trouble and would be cured by this food.[/p][p]The king of Benares is identified with Ananda, Sumukha with Sāriputta, and Suphassā with Rāhulamātā.

When a Buddha is about to be born, the inhabitants of the Suddhāvāsā insert a knowledge of the signs of a Great Being in the Vedas and teach this among men in the guise of brahmins, calling such knowledge buddhamanta.  Men learn it and are thus able to recognize a Great Being (MA.ii.761; SNA.ii.448).  The inhabitants of the Suddhāvāsā know how many Buddhas will be born in any particular kappa by observing the number of lotuses which spring up on the site of the Bodhi-pallanka when the earth gradually emerges after the destruction of the world (DA.ii.411).  It is the Suddhāvāsā Brahmās who provide the four omens which lead to a Bodhisatta's renunciation in his last lay life.  See, e.g., DA.ii.455f.[/p]</e>

[/b] The Bodhisatta was once a merchant of Benares, and, because his household observed the rules of piety, he came to be called Suciparivāra ("pure household").  He kept an unused couch and bed for anyone who might come to his house and was purer than himself.  One day Kālakannī, daughter of Virūpakka and Sirī, Dhatarattha's daughter, went to bathe in Anotatta, and a quarrel arose as to which should bathe first.  As neither the Four Regent Gods nor Sakka were willing to decide, they referred the two goddesses to Suciparivāra.  Kālakannī first appeared before him in blue raiment and jewels, and, on being asked what were her qualities, she told him, and was asked to vanish from his sight.  Then came Sirī, diffusing yellow radiance, and the Bodhisatta, discovering her identity and her virtues, welcomed her and offered her his unused couch.  Thus was the dispute settled.  The bed used by Sirī came to be called Sirisaya, hence the origin of Sirisayana.[/p][p]Sirī is identified with Uppalavannā.  J.iii.  257-64.[/p]</e>

One day, while on a visit to the monastery, Suppiyā saw a sick monk who needed a meat broth.  On her return home, she sent an attendant to fetch meat; but there was none to be had in the whole of Benares.  She therefore, with a knife, cut a piece of flesh from her thigh and gave it to her servant to make into soup for the monk.  She then went to her room and lay on her bed.  When Suppiya returned and discovered what had happened he was overjoyed, and, going to the monastery, invited the Buddha to a meal the next day.  The Buddha accepted the invitation, and when, on the next day, he arrived with his monks, he asked for Suppiyā.  On hearing that she was ill, he desired that she be brought to see him.  At the moment when the Buddha saw her wound was healed, covered with good skin, on which grew fine hairs as on the rest of her body.[/p][p]It was as a result of this incident that the Buddha lay down a rule forbidding monks to eat human flesh, even when willingly given (Vin.i.216f).[/p][p]Suppiyā is given as an example of one whose good deeds bore fruit in this very life (Mil.115; cf.291).

  <e>[div class="huge"]Surāpāna Jātaka (No.  81)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta was once born in the Udiccabrāmanakula, and became a hermit with five hundred pupils.  One day his pupils went, with his leave, to Benares, to the haunts of men, for salt and vinegar.  The king welcomed them, and invited them to stay in the royal park for four months.  During this time a drinking festival was held in the city, and the people, thinking to give the hermits a rare gift, entertained them to the best they had.  The hermits became drunk and behaved with undue hilarity.  When they emerged from their stupor and realized what they had done, they left the city and hastened back to their teacher.[/p][p]The story was related in reference to the occasion on which Sāgata Thera (q.v.) got drunk.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Suvannakakkata Jātaka (No.  389)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta was a brahmin farmer of Sālindiya.  On the way to his fields he passed a pond and grew friendly with a golden crab living in the pond.  A she-crow longed to eat the farmer's eyes, and persuaded her husband to induce a snake to bite the farmer.  This he did, and, overcome with the poison, the farmer fell near the pool.  Attracted by the noise, the crab emerged, and, seeing the crow about to peck out the farmer's eyes, caught the crow with his claws.  When the snake came to the rescue of the crow, the crab fastened on him too.  The crab made the snake suck the poison from the farmer's body, and, when he stood up, the crab crushed the necks of both the snake and the crow and killed them.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to Ananda's attempt to save the Buddha from the elephant (Dhanapāla) sent by Devadatta to kill him, by standing between the elephant and the Buddha.[/p][p]Māra was the serpent, Devadatta the crow, and Ananda, the crab.

She became a lay disciple, but later, agitated in mind, she joined the Order and became an arahant.  After that she lived in Sāvatthi.  One day, as she was enjoying her siesta in the Andhavana under a tree, Māra, in the guise of a stranger, approached her and tried to tempt her.  But she refuted his statements regarding the attractions of lay life, and Māra had to retire discomfited (S.i.134; Thig.vss.57-9).[/p][p]In the time of Padumuttara Buddha Selā was born in the family of a clansman of Hamsavatī and was given in marriage.

The king entertained them and told them of his worry because he had no sons.  Some time later, when the ascetics were returning, Mahā Rakkhita saw that the king would have a son and told his companions so.  One of the ascetics, a cheat, hoping to get gain thereby, feigned illness, and, returning to the palace, told the king that a son would be born to his queen, Sudhammā.  The king showed him great honour, and he came to be called Dibbacakkhuka.  In due course, the Bodhisatta was born as the king's son, and was named Somanassa.  When the boy was seven years old the king had to leave home to quell a border rising, and Somanassa was left in the charge of the cheating ascetic.  The boy soon discovered his real nature and paid him no honour.  As soon as the king returned, Dibbacakkhu complained to him that the prince had ill treated him.  Somanassa was ordered to be executed, but he exposed the cheat's knavery, and men, sent to search his hut, found bundles of money in it.  Disgusted with life at court, Somanassa obtained the king's leave and became an ascetic in the Himālaya, where Vissakamma, commanded by Sakka, built a hermitage for him.

He did not awake till morning, and then, looking for a way of escape, met a brahmin.  Promising to show him a spot where lay hidden two hundred pieces of gold, he persuaded the brahmin to carry him out of the city in his waist cloth.  Arrived at the cemetery, he asked the brahmin to spread his robe and dig under a tree.  While the brahmin dug, the jackal fouled the robe and ran away.  The Bodhisatta, then a tree sprite, advised the brahmin to wash his robe and cease being a fool.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to Devadatta, who is identified with the jackal.

Taking a club, he lay down as though dead.  The Bodhisatta, then king of the jackals, came there with his flock, but in order to make sure that it was a corpse, he pulled at the club.  The man tightened his grip, and the Bodhisatta mocked at his silliness.

Then a storm broke, moistening the hide and allowing him to emerge through the head, but not without losing all his hair as he crawled through.  He thereupon resolved to renounce greediness.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to five hundred companions, rich men of Sāvatthi, who joined the Order.  One night the Buddha perceived that they were filled with thoughts of lust.

The jackal slunk away and hid in a cave.  One by one the lions came in, and when their sister told them of the insult, they tried to reach the jackal by leaping upwards, but perished in the attempt.  At last came the Bodhisatta; being wise, be roared the lion's roar three times and the jackal died.  He then consoled his sister.[/p][p]The story was told to a barber in Vesāli who served the king's household.

Sakka read his thoughts, and, appearing before him as a blind brahmin, asked for his eyes.  The king agreed to give them, and sent for his surgeon Sivaka.  Amid the protests and lamentations of his family and his subjects, Sivi had his eyes removed and given to the brahmin.  It is said that the surgeon did his work in several stages, giving Sivi chances of withdrawing his offer.  When the sockets healed Sivi wished to become an ascetic, and went into the park with one attendant.  Sakka's throne grew hot, and appearing before Sivi, he offered him a boon.  The king wished to die, but Sakka insisted on his choosing something else.  He then asked that his sight might be restored.  Sakka suggested an Act of Truth (sacca-kiriyā), as not even Sakka could restore lost sight.  The eyes reappeared, but they were neither natural eyes nor divine, but eyes called "Truth, Absolute and Perfect." Sivi collected all his subjects, and, resting on a throne in a pavilion, taught them the value of gifts.[/p][p]The story was related in reference to Pasenadi's Asadisadāna.

The smith's daughter, who was fanning her father, spoke to the Bodhisatta and asked him to go elsewhere, as no one in that village would want needles.  The Bodhisatta answered that his were no ordinary needles, and the head smith asked him to show them.  The Bodhisatta suggested that all the smiths be summoned, and in their presence he gave the needle-tube to the head smith.  He thought that it was the needle itself, for he could find no end or tip.

Sumanā.[/b] Called Sumanārājakumārī.  She was the daughter of the king of Kosala and sister of Pasenadi.  She is included among the eminent upāsikās (A.iv.347).  She once visited the Buddha, with five hundred royal maidens in five hundred royal chariots, and questioned him regarding the efficacy of giving (See Sumanārājakumārī Sutta, A.iii.32f).[/p][p]The Commentary explains (AA.ii.593f ) that these five hundred companions were born on the same day as herself.  She was seven years old when the Buddha paid his first visit to Sāvatthi, and she was present at the dedication of Jetavana with her five hundred companions, carrying vases, flowers, etc., as offering to the Buddha.  After the Buddha's sermon she became a sotāpanna.[/p][p]It is said that, in the time of Vipassī Buddha, she belonged to a setthi family, her father being dead.  When the people, almost at the point of the sword, obtained the king's permission to entertain the Buddha and his monks, it was the senāpati's privilege to invite the Buddha to his house on the first day.  When Sumanā came back from playing, she found her mother in tears, and when asked the reason, her mother replied, "If your father had been alive, ours would have been the privilege of entertaining the Buddha today." Sumanā comforted her by saying that that honour should yet be theirs.  She filled a golden bowl with richly flavoured milk rice, covering it with another bowl.  She then wrapped both vessels all round with jasmine flowers and left the house with her slaves.  On the way to the senāpati's house she was stopped by his men, but she coaxed them to let her pass, and, as the Buddha approached, saying that she wished to offer him a jasmine garland, she put the two vessels into his alms bowl.  She then made the resolve that in every subsequent birth she should be named Sumanā and that her body should be like a garland of jasmine.  When the Buddha arrived in the senāpati's house and was served first with soup, he covered his bowl saying that he had already been given his food.  At the end of the meal the senāpati made enquiries, and, full of admiration for Sumanā's courage, invited her to his house and made her his chief consort.  Ever after that she was known as Sumanā, and, wherever she was born, a shower of jasmine flowers fell knee deep on the day of her birth.[/p][p]According to the Therīgāthā Commentary (ThigA.22f), Sumanā joined the Order in her old age.  She was present when the Buddha preached to Pasenadi, the discourse (S.i.68-70) beginning with, "There are four young creatures, Sire, who may not be disregarded," and Pasenadi was established in the Refuges and the Precepts.  Sumanā wished to leave the world, but put off doing so that she might look after her grandmother as long as she lived.[/p][p]After the grandmother's death, Sumanā went with Pasenadi to the vihāra, taking such things as rugs and carpets, which she presented to the Order.  The Buddha preached to her and to Pasenadi, and she became an anāgāmī.  She then sought ordination, and, at the conclusion of the stanzas (Thig.vs.16) preached to her by the Buddha, attained arahantship.[/p][hr][p][b]7. Sumanā Therī.

After the army of the Pandu king had plundered a great part of the kingdom, Sena made a treaty with him and re-gained his throne.  He adopted the three sons and the three daughters of Kittaggabodhi: Kassapa, Sena and Udaya, and Sanghā, Tissā and Kitti.  Among the king's good acts was the construction of a monastery on Aritthapabbata for the Pamsukulikas, and a many storeyed pāsāda in Jetavana.  He also built the Vīrankurārāma, the Pubbārāma, Sangha-sena-parivena, Senaggabodhi-vihāra, a refectory in the Mahāmettapabbata-vihāra, and single cells in the Kappūra and Uttarālha-parivenas.  He completed the Dappulapabbata- and the Kassaparājaka-vihāras.  Among Sena's ministers were Bhadda (the senāpati), Uttara, Vajira and Rakkhasa.  His capital was in Pulatthinagara (Cv.l.1ff).

Sena sent an expeditionary force against the Pandu king, captured Madhurā, and brought back the treasures which had been pillaged by the Pandus in the time of Sena I.  The Pamsukulika monks separated from the incumbents of Abhayagiri in the twentieth year of Sena's reign.  He built the Manimekhala dam and a dam across the Kanavāpi at Katthantanagara.  He endowed various monasteries - Buddhagāma, Mahiyangana, Kūtatissa, Mandalagiri, and Sobbha - and held a special ceremony in honour of the image of Ananda.

One day he took strong drink and blocked the Buddha's path, refusing to move in spite of the repeated requests of the monks.  The Buddha thereupon turned back.  Ananda seeing the Buddha smile and enquiring the reason for the smile, was told that, at the end of seven days, Suppabuddha would be swallowed up by the earth at the foot of his stairs.  Suppabuddha overheard this, and had all his belongings carried to the seventh storey of his house.  He removed the stairway, closed all doors, and set a strong guard.  On the seventh day a state charger belonging to Suppabuddha broke loose.  None could manage him except Suppabuddha, and he, desiring to seize the animal, moved towards the door.  The doors opened of their own accord, the stairway returned to its place, and the strong guard threw him down the stairs.

The Garuda, by his power, raised a storm in the city and covered it with darkness, under cover of which he carried off Sussondī.

In the course of his wanderings, Sagga came to Bhārukaccha and took ship for Suvannabhūmi.  In the middle of the ocean the sailors asked Sagga to play for them, but Sagga told them that his music would excite the big fish and trouble would ensue.  The sailors, however, insisting, Sagga played, and the fish, maddened by the sound, splashed about, and the ship broke in two under the leap of a sea-monster.

This they did, and when Mahāsona and Suhanu were confronted with each other they showed great affection, and started licking each other.  The king saw this, and was told by his minister that the horses recognized each other's virtues.  He then warned the king against excessive covetousness.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to two hot headed monks, both passionate and cruel.  One lived in Jetavana and the other in the country.  One day the country monk came to Jetavana, and the monks eagerly awaited their quarrel.  But when the two monks met they showed great affection.  The Buddha explained that this was because of their like nature.  J.ii.30-32.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Sumanā-rājakumārī Sutta[/div][p]Sumanā, sister of Pasenadi, visits the Buddha at Jetavana with five hundred companions in five hundred chariots and asks him whether, in the case of two disciples, alike in faith, virtue and insight, the one being an almsgiver and the other not, there be any distinction.  The Buddha replies that whether they be born in the deva world or in the world of men, the giver would be superior in life span, beauty, happiness, honour and power.  There would still be a difference between them, even when, in later life, they both enter the Order, but the difference would cease to exist on their becoming arahants (A.iii.32f).[/p][p]The Commentary adds (AA.ii.595f ) that Sumanā's questions were the result of a conversation between two babies born in the house of the King of Kosala, one as the king's son, the other as the son of one of the attendant women.  The children were laid side by side on two beds, the prince's bed being higher and better.  They had both been monks in their previous life; the prince was a sārānīyadhammapūraka, the other a bhattaggapūraka.  The prince saw his past life, and, realizing that the other had not taken his advice and had, therefore, suffered eclipse, addressed him as he lay on the next bed.  Sumanā heard their talk, but spoke no word of it to anyone, in case the children should be thought to be possessed of evil spirits.[/p]</e>

At first the people thought that the monks were the friends of the demon, but later the monks, being told the story, drove away the demon by their iddhi power and erected a bulwark round the country by reciting the Brahmajāla Sutta.  Sixty thousand people embraced the new faith, while three thousand five hundred young men and fifteen hundred girls of noble family entered the Order.

When this was reported to the teacher, he told Setaketu that the four quarters were parents, teachers, generous householders, and deliverance from misery.  Later, Setaketu left for Takkasilā, and, after finishing his studies there, went to Benares with five hundred ascetics.

(The Commentary explains that women, when boiling rice, cannot tell if it is cooked without testing it between two fingers, hence the expression).  Somā rebuked him, saying that the fact of being a woman was no obstacle to the comprehension of the Dhamma.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Sunakkhatta[/div][p]A Licchavi prince of Vesāli.  He was, at one time, a member of the Order and the personal attendant of the Buddha (anibaddhaupatthāka), but was later converted to the views of Korakkhattiya and went about defaming the Buddha, saying that he had nothing superhuman and was not distinguished from other men by preaching a saving faith: that the doctrine preached by him did not lead to the destruction of sorrow, etc.  Sāriputta, on his alms rounds in Vesāli, heard all this and reported it to the Buddha, who thereupon preached the Mahāsīhanāda Sutta (M.i.68ff.; the Buddha was, at this time, eighty years old, M.i.82) and the Lomahamsa Jātaka (J.i.389f.; see also J.iv.95).  The Sunakkhatta Sutta (M.ii.252ff) was evidently preached to Sunakkhatta before he joined the Order, while the Pātika Sutta (D.iii.1ff) gives an account of his dissatisfaction.[/p][p]His grievance was that the Buddha showed no mystic superhuman wonders, that he had not shown him the beginning of things.  The Buddha reminded him that he had not promised to do any of these things, and that, at one time, Sunakkhatta had been loud in his praise of the Buddha and the Dhamma.  The Buddha warned him that people would say he had left the Order because its discipline had proved too hard for him.  The Buddha had told him that Korakkhattiya, whom he so much admired, would be born after death among the Kālakañjaka Asuras within seven days.  It happened as the Buddha prophesied, and the dead body of Kora declared that he was right.  But even so, Sunakkhatta was not convinced.[/p][p]Later he transferred his allegiance to Kandaramasaka, who died, as the Buddha had prophesied, fallen from grace and fame.  The next teacher to win the admiration of Sunakkhatta was Pātikaputta, and Sunakkhatta wished the Buddha to pay honour to him.  But the Buddha quoted to Sunakkhatta the words of Ajita, the Licchavi general who had been born in Tāvatimsa, to the effect that Pātikaputta was "a liar and a cheat," and was later able to prove that these words were true.  But Sunakkhatta did not return to the Order.  He had probably remained in it for several years before actually leaving it.  For we find in the Mahāli Sutta (D.i.152) the Licchavi Otthaddha relating to the Buddha how Sunakkhatta had come to him three years after joining the Order, claiming that he could see divine forms but could not hear heavenly sounds.  Buddhaghosa explains (DA.i.311) that he could not acquire the power of hearing divine sounds because in a previous birth he had ruptured the ear drum of a holy monk and made him deaf.  The Sutta itself gives (D.i.153) as the reason that he had only developed one sided concentration of mind.[/p][p]Sunakkhatta is identified with Kānāritha of the Bhūridatta Jātaka.  J.vi.219.[/p]</e>

Sirivaddha, though possessed of no special attainments, received great honour from the laity and recluses, but Sirimā was little honoured.  Nevertheless, exercising calm and insight, he soon won arahantship.  Ordinary monks and novices continued to disparage him, and the Thera had to blame them for their faulty judgment.  Sirivaddha, agitated by this, himself became an arahant.[/p][p]In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, before the Buddha's appearance in the world, Sirimā was an ascetic, named Devala, with a large following, and, having learnt the power of the Buddha through a study of the science of prognostication, he built a sand thūpa, to which he paid homage in the name of past Buddhas.  The Buddha was born in the world, his birth being accompanied by various omens.  The ascetic showed these to his pupils, and, having made them eager to see the Buddha, died, and was reborn in the Brahma world.

She was once employed by Uttarā (Nandamātā) to take her place with her husband (Sumana) while Uttarā herself went away in order to indulge in acts of piety.  During this time Sirimā tried to injure Uttarā, on account of a misunderstanding, but on realizing her error, she begged forgiveness both of Uttarā, and, at the latter's suggestion, of the Buddha.  (The details of this incident are given Uttarā Nandamātā.) At the conclusion of a sermon preached by the Buddha in Uttarā's house, Sirimā became a sotāpanna.  From that day onwards she gave alms daily to eight monks in her house.[/p][p]A monk in a monastery, three leagues away, having heard of the excellence of Sirimā's alms and of her extraordinary beauty from a visiting monk, decided to go and see her.  Having obtained a ticket for alms, he went to her house, but Sirimā was ill, and her attendants looked after the monks.  When the meal had been served she was brought into the dining hall to pay her respects to the monks.  The lustful monk at once fell in love with her and was unable to eat.  That same day Sirimā died.  The Buddha gave instructions that her body should not be burnt, but laid in the charnel ground, protected from birds and beasts.  When putrefaction had set in, the king proclaimed that all citizens, on penalty of a fine, should gaze on Sirimā's body.  The Buddha, too, went with the monks, the lustful monk accompanying them.  The Buddha made the king proclaim, with beating of the drum, that anyone who would pay a thousand could have Sirimā's body.  There was no response.  The price was gradually lowered to one eighth of a penny.  Yet no one came forward, even when the body was offered for nothing.  The Buddha addressed the monks, pointing out how even those who would have paid one thousand to spend a single night with Sirimā would not now take her as a gift.  Such was the passing nature of beauty.  The lustful monk became a sotāpanna (DhA.iii.104f.; VvA.74ff).[/p][p]Buddhaghosa says (SNA.i.244f, 253f ) that Sirimā was Sālavati's daughter, and succeeded to her mother's position as courtezan.

In ancient times students came to the university from Lāla (J.i.447), from the Kuru country (DhA.iv.88), from Magadha (J.v.161), and from the Sivi country (J.v.210).[/p][p][/p][p]The students in the university studied the three Vedas and the eighteen sciences (vijjā) (J.i.159), which evidently included the science of archery (J.i.356; DhA.iv.66; also medicine and surgery, Vin.i.269f), the art of swordmanship (J.v.128), and elephant-craft (hatthi-sutta) (J.ii.47).  Mention is also made of the study of magic, such as the Ālambanamanta, for charming snakes (J.iv.457), and the Nidhiuddharanamanta, for recovering buried treasure (J.iii.116).  The students were also taught the science of ritual (manta) (J.ii.200); but in this branch of learning Benares seems to have had a greater reputation, for we find students being sent there from Takkasilā in order to learn the mantas (DhA.iii.445).[/p][p][/p][p]The students generally paid a fee to the teacher on admission, the usual amount being one thousand gold pieces.  They waited on the teacher by day and were taught by him at night.  The paying students were entitled to various privileges, and lived with the teacher as members of his family, enjoying his constant company.  The students seem mostly to have done their own domestic work, leading a co-operate life, gathering their own firewood and cooking their meals, though mention is made of servants, both male and female, helping in the various tasks (J.i.319).[/p][p][/p][p]Only brāhmanas and khattiyas appear to have been eligible for admission to Takkasilā (J.iv.391).[/p][p]Discipline was evidently very rigorous, a breach of the rules being severely punished, irrespective of the status of the pupil, who was sometimes flogged on the back with a bamboo stick (J.ii.277f).  Often the most promising students were given the daughters of the teachers in marriage as a mark of very special favour.  (E.g., DhA.iv.66. Elsewhere (J.vi.347) it is stated that the teacher's daughter was given to the eldest pupil).  [/p][p][/p][p]Sometimes the teacher and his pupils were invited to a meal at the house of a chief man of the city (J.iv.391).  The principal teacher was called Disāpāmokkhācariya; under him were assistants, usually chosen from among his students, who were called pitthiācariyā (E.g., J.ii.100).[/p][p][/p][p]Takkasilā, being the capital of Gandhāra, was probably also the seat of government.  Bimbisāra's contemporary in Gandhāra was Pukkusāti (J.i.399; ii.218).  Mention is made in the Jātakas of a Takkasilā-rājā (AA.i.153; MA.i.335; ii.979, 987f).  According to the Kumbhakāra Jātaka (q.v.), Takkasilā was the capital of Naggaji.  The Dīpavamsa (iii.31) records that twelve kings, descendants of Dīpankara, ruled in succession at Takkasilā.[/p][p][/p][p]It is said in the Divyāvadāna (p.371) that Bindusāra's empire included Takkasilā.  There was once a rebellion there and Asoka was sent to quell it.  From the minor Rock Edict II.  of Asoka it would appear that Takkasilā was the headquarters of a provincial government at Gandhāra, placed under a Kumāra or Viceroy.  A rebellion broke out there again in the time of Asoka, who sent his son Kunāla to settle it.[/p][p][/p][p]Takkasilā is identified with the Greek Taxila, in Rawalpindi in the Punjab.[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Tittha Jātaka (No.25)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta was once adviser to the king of Benares.  One day, another horse was washed in the place reserved for the king's state charger, who, when taken there to bathe, refused to enter.  The Bodhisatta, divining the reason, directed that the horse should be taken elsewhere, and not always bathed in the same spot, adding that a man will tire even of the daintiest food, if it never be changed.  The Bodhisatta was amply rewarded for his skill in reading the horse's thoughts.  [/p][p][/p][p]The story was told in reference to a monk, a disciple of Sāriputta.  He had been a goldsmith and the meditation on impurity, prescribed for him by Sāriputta, proved impossible for him.  He was taken to see the Buddha, who asked him to gaze at a lotus in a pond near by.  The monk saw the lotus fade and, developing insight, became an arahant.  He marvelled at the Buddha's power of reading the thoughts and temperaments of others.[/p][p][/p][p]The monk is identified with the state charger and Ananda with the king.  J.i.182ff[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Tayodhamma Jātaka (No.58)[/div][p]Once Devadatta was born as king of the monkeys, and the Bodhisatta was his son.  The monkey-king had the habit of gelding with his teeth all his male offspring, lest they should one day supersede him; but the Bodhisatta's mother left the herd before the child was born and brought him up elsewhere.  When he grew up he came to see the monkey-king, and on the latter's trying to kill him by crushing him in a false embrace, the Bodhisatta showed greater strength than his sire.  Then Devadatta asked him to fetch lotuses from a neighbouring lake, which was inhabited by an ogre, saying that he wished to crown his son as king.  The Bodhisatta guessed the presence of the ogre and plucked the flowers by leaping several times from one bank to the other, grasping them on his way.  The ogre seeing this expressed his admiration, saying that those who combine the three qualities of dexterity, valour, and resource can never be vanquished.  When the monkey-king saw his son returning with the ogre, who was carrying the flowers, he died of a broken heart.  The story was related in reference to hunting.  J.i.280-3.[/p]</e>

  <e>[div class="huge"]Tapodā[/div][p]A large lake below the Vebhāra mountain, outside Rājagaha.  The lake was cool, but the stream flowing from it, also called Tapodā (Vin.iii.108; iv.116f; DA.i.35; UdA.110), was hot.  Around it was the Tapodārāma (q.v.).  [/p][p][/p][p]It is said (SA.i.30f; Sp.ii.512) that the water of the river was hot because it flowed between two Lohakumbhi-nirayas, which existed under Rājagaha.  The lake was the playground of the Nāgas who dwelt at the foot of the Vebhāra mountain.  Monks and recluses were evidently in the habit of going to the Tapodā to bathe in the hot springs.  Thus, we find Samiddhi being questioned by a deity as he dried himself after bathing in the Tapodā (S.i.8ff; M.iii.192ff; J.ii.56), and the Anguttara Nikāya (v.196f) records a discussion between Ananda and the paribbājaka Kokanuda, on the banks of the Tapodā, where they had gone to bathe.[/p]</e>
  <e>[div class="huge"]Takkala Jātaka (No.446)[/div][p]Once in a village lived a man called Vasitthaka, an only son, who looked after his father with great devotion, until the latter, much against the wishes of his son, found a wife for him.  A son was born to the pair and, when seven years old, he overheard his mother planning to have the old man taken by a ruse to the cemetery and there killed and buried in a pit.  The next morning, when his father set out in a cart for the cemetery, the child insisted on accompanying him.  Having watched his father dig a pit, he asked what it was for, and was told that the useless old man was a burden to keep and that the pit was for him.  The boy was silent, and when his father stopped to have a rest, he took up the spade and began to dig another hole.  On being asked the reason, he said it was for his father when he should be too old to be supported.  This remark opened Vasitthaka's eyes; he returned home and drove away his wife.  He afterwards took her back on her promising to give up her treacherous ways.[/p][p][/p][p]The story was related to a man who had looked after his father; but the wife, whom he took at his father's wish, wanted to get rid of the old man, and suggested the idea to her husband.  But his answer was that if she found the house inconvenient she could go elsewhere.  The Buddha said that the characters of both stories were identical, and that he himself was the lad of the atītavatthu.  J.iv.43-50.[/p]</e>

[/p][p][/p][p]But, probably, the whole of this locality later came to be referred to by this name, for Therambatthala is mentioned (Vsm.155, 375; DhSA 187) as the residence of monks, among them, Buddha-Rakkhita and Mahā-Rohanagutta.[/p]</e>

Looking for water but finding none, he let himself down into the hermit's well but was unable to get out again; the hermit rescued him and showed him every hospitality.  Later the hermit visited the king, now restored to the throne, and was given a dwelling place in the royal park.  The courtiers were inclined to be jealous of the attentions paid to the hermit, but the king told them of the incident in the forest and they acknowledged the hermit's claim to honour.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to Ananda having received five hundred robes from the women of Pasenadi's palace.

  <e>[div class="huge"]Tambapanni[/div][p]The name given to that district in Ceylon where Vijaya landed after leaving Suppāraka (Mhv.vi.47; Dpv.ix.30).  It is said to have been so called because when Vijaya's followers, having disembarked from the ship, sat down there, wearied, resting their hands on the ground, they found them coloured by the red dust that lay there.  Later on Vijaya founded his capital in Tambapanni, and following that the whole island came to bear the same name (Dpv.vii.38-42).  Tambapanni was originally inhabited by Yakkhas, having their capital at Sirīsavatthu (q.v.).  The Valāhassa Jātaka (J.ii.129) speaks of a Tambapannisara.  According to the Samyutta Commentary (ii.83; but in VbhA.p.444 it is spoken of as tiyojana satika), the Tambapannidīpa was one hundred leagues in extent.[/p][p][/p][p]Anurādhapura formed the Majjhimadesa in Tambapannidīpa, the rest being the Paccantimadesa (AA.i.265).[/p][p]In Asoka's Rock Edicts II.  and XIII.

Vincent Smith (Asoka (3rd edn.), p.163; but see Ind.  Antiq., 1919, p.195f ) identifies this, not with Ceylon, but with the river Tāmraparni in Tinnevelly.[/p]</e>

Wishing for the death of the latter, the chaplain asked the king to build anew the southern gate of his city, and declared that on the day the gate was set up a tawny-brown brahmin should be killed and sacrificed to the guardian spirits.  The king agreed, but the chaplain, unable to restrain his wife's conduct, told her about it.  The news spread abroad, and all tawny-brown brahmins fled from the city, leaving, on the auspicious day, only the chaplain.  The people demanded that he should be slain to avert ill-luck, and that his pupil, Takkāriya (the Bodhisatta), should be appointed in his place.  The chaplain confessed his plan to Takkāriya, who thereupon related several stories showing how "silence is golden." In the end Takkāriya allowed the chaplain to flee from the city, and had the corpse of a goat buried under the city gates in the dead of night (J.iv.242ff).[/p][p][/p][p]The story was related in reference to Kokālika, who came to grief by abusing the Chief Disciples.

His son, thereupon, came to be called Theraputtābhaya (Mhv.xxiii.2, 63ff).  At the end of Dutthagāmani's campaigns, Abhaya took leave of the king and joined the Order, became an arahant, and lived with five hundred other arahants (Mhv.xxvi.2).  When Dutthagāmani lay on his deathbed Abhaya visited him and gladdened his heart by reminding him of the works of great merit he had done (Mhv.xxxii.48ff).[/p][p]In a previous birth he had given milk-rice to monks, hence his great strength (MT.453).[/p]</e>

When Cullatundila discovered this, he ran to his brother, but the latter preached to him how it was the fate of pigs to be slaughtered for their flesh; he should, therefore, meet his death bravely.  All Benares heard the Bodhisatta's preaching, and flocked to the spot.  The king adopted the pigs as his sons and Mahātundila was appointed to the seat of judgment.  On the king's death, he wrote a book of law for the guidance of future generations.[/p][p][/p][p]The story was related in reference to a monk who was in constant terror of the thought of death.  The monk was identified with Cullatundila (J.iii.286ff).[/p][p][/p][p]It is said (DhA.i.83) that the lewd men were identical with the Bhaddavaggiyā.  Having heard Mahātundila preach the five precepts, they observed them for sixty thousand years, hence their attainment of arahantship as in their last birth.[/p][p]Mahātundila's preaching is referred to as the Tundilovāda.[/p]</e>

Bu.ii.213; J.i.29; Mbv.5.[/p][hr][p][b]5. Tissa[/b].-An aggasāvaka of Kassapa Buddha.  He was the Buddha's brother and, having renounced the household, became an ascetic.  On hearing that Kassapa had become Buddha, he visited him but expressed great disappointment on discovering that he ate flesh food (āmagandha).  The Buddha taught him that āmagandha was not really flesh but the kilesas which corrupt the heart, and he preached to him the Āmagandha Sutta.  Tissa immediately entered the Order and became an aggasāvaka (Bu.xxv.39; SNA.i.280-2, 293; D.ii.4).  Tissa's father was born as Subhadda in this age.  Ap.i.101.[/p][hr][p][b]6. Tissa.[/b]-A monk who was reborn as a Brahmā with great iddhi-powers.  Moggallāna visited him soon after his birth in the Brahma-world and asked him questions about devas and Brahmas who were assured of salvation (A.iii.331; iv.75ff).  He was evidently the Tissa mentioned as being present at the Mahāsamaya.  D.ii.261; DA.ii.692.[/p][hr][p][b]7. Tissa.[/b]-A friend of Metteyya.  They together visited the Buddha at Jetavana and, having listened to his teaching, entered the Order.  Metteyya retired with his teacher into the forest and not long after became an arahant.  Tissa lived in Sāvatthi and when his elder brother died, he went home and was persuaded by his relations to return to the lay life.  Later, Metteyya, passing through the village with the Buddha, during a journey, visited Tissa and brought him once more to the Buddha.  The Buddha preached to them the Tissa-Metteyya Sutta, at the end of which Tissa became a Sotāpanna, later attaining arahantship.  SN., p.160f; SNA.ii.535f, NidA.184.[/p][hr][p][b]8. Tissa.[/b]-The personal name of Metteyya, friend of Tissa (7).  Metteyya was his gotta-name by which he became known (SNA.ii.536; NidA.184).  In the Sutta Nipāta (vs.814) he is called Tissa-Metteyya.[/p][hr][p][b]9. Tissa-Metteyya.[/b]-A disciple of Bāvarī.  He visited the Buddha with his colleagues and when the Buddha answered his questions, he, and his thousand pupils became arahants.  Tissa was his personal name and Metteyya that of his clan.  SN., vs.1040-2; SNA.ii.588.[/p][hr][p][b]10. Tissa.[/b]-An Elder of Sāvatthi.  He once received a length of coarse cloth as a gift and handed it to his sister to be made into a robe.  She had the cloth pounded and spun into fine yarn and made of it a soft robe-cloth.  At first Tissa would not accept it but was prevailed upon to do so and had it made into a soft robe by skilled robe-makers.  He died on the night it was finished and, as a result of his fancy for it, was reborn as a louse in the robe.  After his death, the monks wished to divide the robe but the louse started shouting.  The Buddha, hearing this by his power of divine audience, asked the monks to lay the robe aside for seven days.  At the end of that period, the louse was reborn in the Tusita world.  DhA.iii.341ff.[/p][hr][p][b]11. Tissa.[/b]-A monk.  When the Buddha declared that in four months he would pass away, many monks were greatly excited, collecting in groups, not knowing what to do.  But Tissa remained aloof, determined to win arahantship before the Buddha's death.  The others, misunderstanding him, reported to the Buddha that Tissa had no love for him, but the Buddha, having questioned him, praised his earnestness.  DhA.iii.267f.[/p][hr][p][b]12. Tissa Thera.[/b]-An arahant.  He belonged to a brahmin family of Rājagaha and, having attained great proficiency in the Vedas, became a teacher of five hundred young men.  When the Buddha visited Rājagaha, Tissa was so struck by his majesty that he joined the Order, later winning arahantship.  The Theragāthā contains verses uttered by him regarding certain monks who were jealous of his great renown.[/p][p]In the time of Piyadassī Buddha, Tissa was an ascetic.  Seeing the Buddha in samādhi in a forest-grove, he built over him an arbour of silo flowers and for seven days paid him homage.  (Thag.vv.153-4; ThagA.i.272f).[/p][p]He is evidently identical with Sālamandapiya of the Apadāna (ii.431f).[/p][hr][p][b]13. Tissa.[/b]-A rājā of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/roruka,Roruva')"]Roruva[/a].  He was an "unseen" ally of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bimbisara,Bimbisāra')"]Bimbisāra[/a] and, as such, sent him various gifts.  The king sent him in return a painted panel on which was depicted the life of the Buddha and a gold plate specially inscribed with the [a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/n_r/paticca_samuppaada,Paticcasamuppāda')"]Paticcasamuppāda[/a].

Fifty-seven kappas ago he was four times king under the name of Santa (Bhavanimmita) (Thag.97; ThagA.i.199f).  He is probably identical with Phalakadāyaka of the Apadāna (i.174).[/p][hr][p][b] [a name="14"]14[/a].  Tissa Thera.[/b]-An arahant.  Son of the Buddha's paternal aunt, Amitā.  He entered the Order and dwelt in a woodland settlement, but he was proud of his rank and irritable and captious in his conduct.  He once came to the Buddha in tears because his colleagues had teased him on account of his talkativeness (S.ii.282; MA.i.289).  On another occasion, the Buddha, with his celestial eye, saw Tissa sleeping with open mouth during the siesta and, sending a ray of glory, woke him.  Tissa's heart was filled with anguish and when he confessed to his colleagues his mental laziness and distaste for religion, they brought him to the Buddha.  The Buddha preached to him the Tissa Sutta, at the end of which he became an arahant (Thag.v.39; but see v.1162; S.iii.106f; ThagA.i.105).[/p][p]In the time of Tissa Buddha he swept the leaves from the foot of the Bodhi-tree.  He is evidently identical with Bodhisammajjaka of the Apadāna (Ap.ii.457f).[/p][p]The Dhammapada Commentary (i.31ff) calls him Thullatissa.  He entered the Order when old and became fat through idleness.  He spent most of his time in the Waiting-hall draped in rich robes.  Monks, taking him for a Mahā Thera, begged the privilege of performing various services for him, such as massaging his feet.  But when they discovered his attainments, they reviled him and he sought the Buddha.  The Buddha, however, asked him to obtain their pardon for having failed to show them due honour, and when he refused, related to him the story of Nārada and Devala.[/p][hr][p][b]15. Tissa.[/b]-A novice.  He was a gatekeeper's son and, coming with some carpenters to Sāvatthi, joined the Order.  He was constantly finding fault with the food and other offerings, even those given by Anāthapindika, and he boasted of the riches enjoyed by his kinsfolk.  His colleagues made enquiries and, discovering the truth about his antecedents, reported him to the Buddha who preached the Katāhaka Jātaka (q.v.) to show his similar tendencies in the past (DhA.iii.367).  Tissa was identified with Katāhaka of the Jātaka.  J.i.455.[/p][hr][p][b]16. Tissa.[/b]-A monk.  He was called Kosambivāsī Tissa.  He spent the rainy season at Kosambī and, on his departure, his supporter gave him three robes and other offerings; he, however, refused them saying that he had no novice to look after them.  The layman immediately gave his son, then seven years old, to be his novice.  The boy attained arahantship in the Tonsure-hall.  While on his way to Sāvatthi to see the Buddha, Tissa accidentally blinded the novice by hitting his eye with a fan at dawn.  The Elder was filled with remorse and, falling at the boy's feet, asked his pardon.  But the answer was that there was no fault to pardon, the accident was due to samsāra.  When the matter was reported to the Buddha he said that such was the nature of arahants.  They felt no resentment.  At the end of the discourse, Tissa became an arahant (DhA.ii.182ff).[/p][hr][p][b]17. Tissa.[/b]-A monk, called Asubhakammika-Tissa.  He is mentioned in the Commentaries (VibhA.270) as an example of a good friend, devoted to the contemplation of asubha, association with whom helps one to get rid of lust.  His teacher was Mahātissa of Kotapabbata-vihāra.  MT.553.[/p][hr][p][b]18. Tissa.[/b]-A master of writing (lekhācariya).  Even after his death he was known by reason of his writing.

While walking about he saw a lotus open at the rising of the sun.  Immediately afterwards, he heard a slave-girl singing; her song told of how men are subject to death just as the lotus opens to the sun.  Tissa thereupon developed insight and became an arahant.  SNA.ii.397.[/p][hr][p][b]21. Tissa.[/b]-Uncle of Pandukābhaya.  He administered the kingdom when his elder brother, Abhaya, gave up the government.  He was killed by Pandukābhaya.

He died of a bite by a venomous insect.  Asoka was grieved on learning that Tissa's death was due to his failure to obtain ghee in his illness.  Mhv.v.213ff.[/p][hr][p][b]23. Tissa-kumāra.[/b]-Brother of Asoka and his vice-regent.  He once asked Asoka why monks were not joyful and gay and Asoka, in order to teach him the reason, gave him the throne for a week, saying that at the end of the week he would be put to death.  Tissa then realised that monks, who had the constant consciousness of death, could not be merry.[/p][p]He later became a monk under Yonaka Mahādhammarakkhita and lived in the Asokārāma, where he prevented the murder of the theras by the minister sent by Asoka to make the monks hold the uposatha together.  He became an arahant and, on account of his love of solitude, came to be known as Ekavihāriya.  Thag.vv.537-46; ThagA.i.503f; Mhv.v.33, 60, 154ff, 241; SA.iii.125.[/p][hr][p][b]24. Tissa.[/b]-King of Kalyāni and father of Vihāramahādevī (Mhv.xxii.13ff).  His brother Ayya-Uttika entered into an intrigue with the queen and was banished.  He sent the queen a letter through an attendant to an arahant who was in the habit of visiting the palace.  This letter fell into the hands of the king who suspected the arahant himself, owing to a similarity in his writing to that of the intriguer.  The king ordered the arahant to be killed and cast into the sea.  The devas, being offended, caused the sea to overflow the land.  The total destruction of the country was only averted by the king sending his daughter Devī (afterwards Vihāramahadevī), to sea in a golden boat.  The Rasavāhini, however, says he was thrown into a cauldron of boiling oil; see Telakatāhagāthā.[/p][p]Tissa's father was Mutasiva and his grandfather Uttiya.  MT.431.[/p][hr][p][b]25. Tissa.[/b]-A minister of Dutthagāmani.  When the latter fled from Saddhātissa, Tissa joined him and he gave him his own food during the flight.  But the food was ultimately given to a monk (see Tissa 26) who accepted their invitation to the meal.  (For details see Mhv.xxiv.22ff; AA.i.365).  It was probably the mother of this Tissa who, we are told (Vsm., p.63), used a cloth worth one hundred to wipe away the impurities of her son's birth, which cloth she afterwards threw out on to the Tālaveli road hoping that it might prove useful to a pāmsukūlika monk.[/p][hr][p][b]26.

Tissa[/b].-Nephew of Khallātanāga and son of Sumanadevī, step-sister to the king.  With his brothers, Abhaya and Uttara, he conspired to kill the king.  But the conspiracy failed and they committed suicide.  MT.612.[/p][hr][p][b]35. Tissa.[/b]-An artisan (kammāraputta), a previous incarnation of Sāliya.  He lived in Mundagangā and receiving one day as wages the flesh of a boar, he had it cooked by his wife.  When the meal was ready he announced alms; the theras Dhammadinna, Godhiya-Mahātissa, Mahānāga of Samuddavihāra, Mahānāga of Kālavallimandapa, Mahāsangharakkhita, Dhammagutta, Mahānāga of Bhātiyavanka and Maliyamahādeva appeared to accept the alms.  MT.605f.[/p][hr][p][b]36. Tissa.[/b]-A monk resident in Lonagiri (Lenagiri).  He once saw fifty monks, on their way to Nāgadipa on a pilgrimage, returning from their alms-rounds in Mahākhīragāma, with their bowls empty.  Asking them to wait, he returned in a little while with his bowl of milk rice which proved more than enough for the whole company.  Seeing their astonishment, he explained that since he had begun to practise the sārānīya-dhammā, his bowl had never lacked food.[/p][p]At the Giribhandamahāpūjā at Cetiyapabbata, Tissa wished to have for himself two shawls, the most precious things there.  He declared his wish in the presence of others and the king, on being informed, determined that Tissa should not have them, but every time he put out his hand to take the robes, they slipped away, and others took their place.  In the end the robes were given to Tissa (DA.ii.534f; MA.i.545).[/p][hr][p][b]37. Tissa[/b].-A Thera of Sāvatthi, better known as Kutumbiyaputta-Tissa.  He renounced forty crores of wealth and became a monk dwelling in the forest.  His younger brother's wife sent five hundred ruffians to kill him.  He begged them to spare his life for one night and broke his thigh-bone with a stone as token that he would not attempt to escape.  During the night he overcame his pain and, dwelling on his virtues, became an arahant (MA.i.188f; DA.iii.747; Vsm.48).[/p][hr][p][b]38. Tissa.[/b]-A Thera of Sāketa.  He refused to answer questions, saying that he had no time.  On being asked, "Can you find time to die?" he felt ashamed, and going to the Kanikāravālikasamudda-vihāra, instructed monks of varying grades during the rainy season, rousing great enthusiasm among the populace by his preaching (MA.i.350f; DA.iii.1061).[/p][hr][p][b]39.

He complained to his teacher of his distaste for the Order and the latter took him to Cittalapabbata.  There, with great effort, Tissa built for himself a cave and while lying there during the night, became an arahant, dying the next day.  A thūpa called the Tissa-thera-cetiya was erected over his relics and this was still in existence in Buddhaghosa's day (MA.i.312f).[/p][hr][p][b]43. Tissa.[/b]-An attendant of King Saddhā-Tissa.  The king, wishing to eat pheasants, asked Tissa to procure some, having first tested him by threatening to have him executed if he refused to kill fowl for the king's table.  Tissa, even when led to the executioner's block, refused to kill the birds.  The king was thus satisfied that Tissa would not kill pheasants for him.  The next day, Tissa, seeing a fowler hawking some dead pheasants, obtained them for the king (SA.iii.49ff; AA.i.262).[/p][hr][p]44.
