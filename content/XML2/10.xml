  <e>    [div class="huge"]Rāmaneyyaka Sutta[/div][p]Sakka visits the Buddha at Jetavana and asks him what it is which, by situation, is enjoyable.  The Buddha replies that whatever place is occupied by the arahants that is the most enjoyable.  S.i.232; cp.  DhA.ii.195; the verse here ascribed to the Buddha is, in the Thag.  (vs.  991) attributed to Sāriputta.  Both there and in DhA.  (see above) the verse is uttered in reference to Sāriputta's brother, Revata.[/p]</e>
